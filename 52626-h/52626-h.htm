<p class='c005'>“They’ll be here before long.” Jerry Macy’s
eyes calculatingly consulted the wall clock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And, oh, what a surprise!” Veronica Lynne
spoke from the deeps of her own mischievous enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s going to be an occasion of surprises,” predicted
Lucy Warner with the solemnity of a young
owl. “Now why are you laughing, Muriel?” This
very severely as she caught sight of Muriel Harding’s
mirthful face and heard sound of her soft
chuckle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why am I laughing? You know better, Luciferous
Warniferous, than ask me such a—well—such
a leading question.” Muriel failed to make her
laughing features match her reproving tones.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“You’re both up to mischief. Think I don’t
know the signs?” Jerry accused with a long-suffering
air. “Luciferous looks too solemn to be true
and <i>your</i> special variety of giggle is a dead give-away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What special variety?” demanded Muriel with
blank innocence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wouldn’t attempt to classify it,” was Jerry’s
withering retort. “I can only say, ‘it is.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course it is.” Muriel light-heartedly furnished
a rippling little sample. “Hark!” she held
up an arresting hand. “Someone’s coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Three energetic raps on the door followed her announcement.
Then the door opened sufficiently to
admit the laughing face of Leila Harper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Enter the Empress of Wayland Hall,” Leila
heralded. She flung the door wide and bowed in
Miss Remson. She and Vera Mason followed the
little manager. Dressed in her best black satin
gown, Miss Remson appeared signally amused at
the honors done her. Leila was wearing an exquisite
frock of orchid broadcloth. Vera, doll-like
and dainty, looked like a cunning Dresden figure
in a frock of gentian blue taffeta, the faint blue field
scattered thickly with tiny pink rosebuds. Their
light-hued dresses pointed to a celebration, as did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>those of the other girls gathered in ever-hospitable
Room 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Empress of Wayland Hall.” Jerry bowed
to the floor, pretended to lose her balance, but
miraculously recovered it without accident. “Allow
me to conduct you to the throne.” She offered
her arm at a stiff angle. “Bow down, all the
rest of you. Where are your court manners?” She
briskly arraigned the smiling empress’s openly giggling
subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kindly give us a sample of court etiquette,”
Ronny begged with mock humility.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought I had.” Jerry exhibited deep surprise.
“Am I crazy, or are you blind?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ahem! My eye-sight is exceptionally keen,”
Ronny said sweetly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll have it out with you later,” promised Jerry.
“Now don’t interrupt me again in the midst of my
royal duties. Will your majesty please be seated?”
She turned gallantly to the empress. “I would call
your attention to the throne. Observe it closely.
Would you even suspect it of having been ever anything
but a throne?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Never</i>,” Miss Remson made gratifying assurance.
She feigned the most flattering admiration
for the throne. It was composed of Jerry’s couch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>as a foundation, with all the bedding from Marjorie’s
couch stacked upon it. Ronny had contributed
a wonderful cloth of gold couch cover
which her father had lately sent her from Lower
California. Each one of the festive group had contributed
her pet sofa pillows. Three fat velvet ones
had been laid on the floor in front of the dais. The
throne had blossomed into additional gorgeousness
by the profusion of rich-hued pillows which graced
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is a gorgeous and most imposing structure,”
pronounced Miss Remson, her eyes dancing as she
surveyed the metamorphized couch. She prodded
its up-piled softness with an investigating hand, then
raised herself with a nimble little spring to the
place on the right to which Jerry had obsequiously
bowed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you for them kind words. Praise is
sweet, particularly when there are those about who
are shy of proper appreciation. I won’t mention
any names, your Majesty. I’m not speaking of
myself, or you, either. I have too much delicacy to
make disrespectful remarks about <i>us</i>.” Jerry peered
knowingly at her majesty who nodded significant
return.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I trust your Majesty will not see fit to show partiality,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Ronny said very severely. “All here are
entitled to your royal favor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see already the difficulties which attend
royalty.” Miss Remson made a dismayed gesture.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t let it agitate you,” said Jerry. “Such—”
She broke off to answer the door. Robin Page
flitted across the threshold with a frisky little bounce.
“Almost late! Not quite, thank fortune.” She
glanced about the room with visible relief. “They
haven’t come yet. I was so afraid I’d miss the fun.
Two Craig Hall seniors called on me. They asked
me to sing at a musicale they intend to give after the
holidays. Miss French, one of them, has discovered
a prodigy at Craig Hall. She’s a freshie named
Miss Oliver. She can play divinely on the piano.
But she is shy, and hangs backward when she should
come forward. No one at Craig Hall suspected her
of being a musical genius until one night last week.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I know her,” cried Muriel. “She’s a little
girl with black straight hair and gray-blue eyes. I
danced with her at the freshman frolic. She seemed
to be rather timid, so I thought I’d encourage her
by putting down my name on her card for three
dances. I danced one with her then she suddenly
disappeared and didn’t re-appear. I inquired for
her. Some of the freshies said she was shy. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>said she was snippy. I didn’t think her the least
bit snippy. I wrote a note to her on the strength
of her being shy. She answered it in about two
lines. That was rather snippy, I thought. Now I
am all at sea about her. Is she shy, or is she snippy?
That is the question.” Muriel ended with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s bashful,” Robin declared. “Wait until I
salute the Empress of Wayland Hall, and I’ll tell
you more of her.” Robin knelt on a plump blue
velvet cushion at Miss Remson’s feet. The manager
had thriftily set a small foot on each side of the
cushion rather than use it as a foot rest. “Please
pardon your admiring subject for being so neglectful.”
She kissed the manager’s hand in approved
gallant style. “Let me venture to remark, noble
lady: Your throne is a daisy. Why oh, why, am
I not of royalty?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Everyone can’t be. We’d not have thrones
enough to accommodate the royal gang, if you all
qualified,” Jerry pertinently reminded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Restrain your ambitions,” advised Lillian Wenderblatt
cruelly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll make a stagger at it,” sighed Robin. “Now
let me finish telling you about my musical freshie
before the rest of the royal party arrive. Where
was I?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Your last remark on the subject was that no
one had suspected Miss Oliver of being a musical
genius until one night last week,” repeated Katherine
Langly in her quiet, accurate fashion. “See
what splendid attention <i>I</i> was paying to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m charmed by it,” Robin gushed. “There are
times, Kathie, when you are almost respectful to
me. One might think, that, having gained such gratifying
respect from a member of the faculty, I should
be more than entitled to marks of respect from lesser
college lights. Not so.” Robin looked vaguely
about, not daring to allow her eyes to stop at any
single member of the grinning group of girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Another unhappy subject with a chip on her
shoulder.” Jerry waved a hand toward Robin,
thumb out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It behoves the lesser lights of college to be very
careful upon whom they shine.” Lillian’s chin was
raised to a painfully dignified angle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder just <i>who</i> the lesser lights of college
are?” Muriel said in a sweet child-like voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As Empress it appears my duty to quell such
disturbances as may lead to internal war in the
kingdom,” put in the helpful Empress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please, your Majesty, I want to keep on talking,”
instantly petitioned Robin. “Kindly order this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>gang—pardon me, I mean your unruly subjects—to
listen to me. Make them understand that if they
don’t listen <i>now</i>, I sha’n’t tell them a single thing
later.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We got that, your Majesty. Will you allow me
to implore your miffed courtier to go right ahead.
So pleased.” Jerry favored Robin with her far-fetched
conception of a gracious smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t resist such a dazzling display of teeth
and affability. May I ask what toothpaste you
use?” Robin’s own pearl-white teeth showed themselves
in an equally affable smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Same as you do. Now proceed with your tale.
The great moment is rapidly approaching.” Jerry
indicated the clock. “Let us hear about this new
musical wonder before the reception begins all over
again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One night last week,” Robin took up her narrative
precisely where she had left off, “Miss French
heard someone playing the living room piano. The
Craig Hall girls had gone over to Hamilton Hall
in a body to that illustrated lecture: ‘America South
of Us.’ Miss French had stayed in her room. She
had a severe headache.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When she suddenly heard some one playing
Chopin’s Second Nocturne on the piano in the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>divine manner she slipped out of her room and downstairs
to see who it might be. It surprised her even
more to find there was no light in the living room.
She was determined to find out who was in there
in the dark, playing so entrancingly, so she sat
down on the hall bench to wait for the unknown
pianist to finish playing and come out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that odd little black-eyed freshie is a
musician!” Muriel exclaimed. “I knew she had it
in her to be something unusual. She is a dandy
dancer. I suppose that is because of her well-developed
sense of rhythm.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, your black-eyed freshie is a musician. She’s
more than that. She will be the greatest woman
pianist in this country, I believe, before she is many
years older,” Robin asserted with conviction. “She
played that marvelous concert waltz by Wieniawski
while Miss French was listening to her. Then she
gave a little thing by Schumann, and then”—Robin
paused—“she came out of the living room into the
hall and Miss French <i>simply grabbed her</i> and shook
hands with her and told her she was a genius.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What did she say?” came as a general breathless
query.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, she was awfully confused. Miss French
asked her to come to her and Miss Neff’s room and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>spend the evening. She went. Miss French made
cocoa, and nobly drank some with Miss Oliver. She
said she supposed it would give her the headache
all over again. Her headache had stopped magically
when she heard Miss Oliver playing. She surprised
it out of her system, maybe,” Robin said,
laughing. “Anyhow she didn’t have a new headache,
which was a reward of virtue for being nice
to Miss Oliver.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Has anyone at Craig Hall been mean to her?”
Muriel inquired rather threateningly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; only the house has so many more sophs and
juniors than freshies,” Robin explained. “The
juniors there are rather a smug self-satisfied lot, it
seems, and Miss Oliver says she knows the Craig
Hall sophs think her awfully stupid. She’s not used
to being among a lot of girls. She hardly knows
how to talk about the things that interest them. She
was educated at home by her father and two older
brothers. Her father is a noted ornithologist. One
of her brothers is a geologist and the other is curator
of a New York museum. Her father has given
her the very best musical advantages, but he insists
that she shall put college before even her music.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Olivers must be a decidedly interesting
family,” was Kathie’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Miss Oliver’s mother died when Miss Oliver was
a child. Her name is Candace Oliver. Isn’t that a
nice name?” Robin asked animatedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a murmur of agreement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you heard her play, Robin?” asked Miss
Remson from her throne. The manager of Wayland
Hall was not a bit less interested in the “find”
than were the others.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Twice, Miss Remson. I can’t find words to describe
her playing. You must hear her. She is so
obliging about playing. She loves to please. She
was too timid to touch the piano with a crowd of
girls in the house. She stayed at home purposely
the other night for the opportunity to play a little.
I told her about my piano in my room, and advised
her to have one put in hers. She has a single,
second story back. She said, ‘no,’ her father would
not like her to do so. That shows what an honorable
little person she is,” Robin concluded with approval.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To change the subject for only a minute, today
is not the first time I have heard ‘smug’ and ‘self-satisfied’
applied to the junior class. Such conditions
don’t help democracy along. I speak of it now
because Robin has mentioned it, too. A crowd of
“comfies,” who are either too lazy or else too well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>pleased with themselves to care what happens to the
other Hamilton students are as detrimental to
democracy as are snobs.” Leila advanced this opinion
with considerable emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The juniors were enthusiastic enough about the
Beauty contest,” commented Muriel Harding. “I’m
not disputing your opinion, Leila. They made a
lot of fuss over it, I suppose, because it happened
to appeal to them. If you consider the junies smug
and self-satisfied, then they must be. I never knew
you to make a mistake, Irish Oracle, in going
straight to the root of a matter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not making one this time, Matchless
Muriel.” Leila’s blue eyes flashed Muriel a quick,
bright glance. “This year’s junies are so complacent
of their new, high estate. They are pleased as
children with everything that happens so long as it
suits their fancy. You may recall they were much
the same in disposition when we did station duty
and welcomed them to Hamilton as freshies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I remember <i>that</i> of them,” declared Lillian Wenderblatt.
“We thought them so amiable and easy-going.
Later in the year they grew to have a kind
of class stolidity that was positively exasperating at
times.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have watched them this year as junies. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>have not changed. They are not interested in fighting
for the right unless it might mean some gain
for the class. They are partial to glory, but not
to principle. It is a new weed patch in our democratic
garden which we must root out.” Leila’s
mobile face showed a hint of her mental resolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, what a job,” groaned Jerry. “Do you mean
to tell me, Leila—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sh-h-h-h! They’re coming down the hall.”
Vera breathed a sibilant warning. “Ready, everyone
with the new yell. Don’t one of you dare make
a flivver of it.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AT HAMILTON HALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>While Marjorie’s chums were buoyantly preparing
a surprise tea for her she was seated beside
Miss Susanna Hamilton in President Matthews’ office
at Hamilton Hall. An expression of quiet happiness
radiated from her lovely face as she listened
to the heart-cheering words she had never expected
to hear from the embittered grand-niece of Brooke
Hamilton: “I have decided to give the world my
great uncle’s biography.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It had all happened so quickly, she was thinking.
She was glad Miss Susanna had allowed her
to tell her closest friends the good news. Though
it had been near to ten o’clock she had gathered
them into Room 15, and enthusiastically imparted
it to them. Jerry had heard it with Marjorie’s first
exclamatory utterance as she entered their room.
It yet remained to tell Kathie and Lillian the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>While she made an early morning call on them,
the following morning, her intimates gleefully arranged
a tea for her. Into the midst of the preparations
came a surprise for Jerry, who was heading
the tea celebration. The welcome surprise was
hastily bundled out of sight before Jerry had a suspicion
of it. Such lecture periods as claimed the
post graduates were, for once, to be ignored. Even
Kathie had arranged with an obliging member of
the faculty to take her last class for the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie, sitting demurely beside Miss Susanna
in the president’s office, a lovely symphony in warm
brown velvet and furs, was wishing her intimates
could be with her on the great occasion. They had
overflowed with high spirits over this latest, greatest
gift to Hamilton. Small wonder they were
elated. They had fought loyally for true college
spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Regarding herself as Brooke Hamilton’s biographer,
Marjorie’s emotions were jumbled. One moment
she was exalted by Miss Hamilton’s steady
assertion that Marjorie Dean was the one best
equipped mentally to present her distinguished kinsman
simply and truly to the world. Next moment
a wave of utter panic would follow, sweeping away
her newly-formed confidence in herself. She grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>aghast at the bare idea of presuming to take upon
herself so difficult a task. She had never done
any notable theme work in college. How then could
she hope to present the world with a finished biography
to which the great man, Brooke Hamilton,
was entitled?</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am amazed, Miss Hamilton!” President Matthews’
eyes were riveted upon Miss Susanna’s face
in polite bewilderment. They next strayed to Marjorie.
His thought became self-evident. Marjorie
turned very pink.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Doctor Matthews; you are right,” the old
lady said with a fleeting smile. “I am here this afternoon
because of Marjorie. Because of her, you and
I have come to speaking terms. The years were
going fast, and I was not growing less bitter against
the college. Then I met this child. She has led
me back to old Hamilton Hall. I’m here at last,
but still selfish. I came here today to please myself,
even more than her.” It was as though Miss
Susanna had uttered a grim kind of confession.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Susanna is not selfish, Doctor Matthews,”
Marjorie gently contradicted. “She’s unselfish, and
altogether splendid. She came here to do honor to
Mr. Brooke Hamilton’s memory, and give happiness
to us all. It has not been easy for her to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>thrust away the barrier of years. Yet she has done
it. She has been heroically unselfish.” Her voice
rang triumphantly. Her fond smile at Miss Susanna
brought unbidden tears to the old lady’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am happy in agreeing with you, Miss Dean.
Miss Susanna has today demonstrated her complete
unselfishness.” The president bowed to Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I forbid you both to make any more personal
remarks about me,” broke in Miss Susanna’s concise
utterance. “I have been selfish and unfair to Uncle
Brooke’s memory. It is time I did something to
make up for it.” She wagged her head ruefully.
“May I ask, Doctor Matthews, have you ever heard
the story of my disagreement with the Board?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have heard a story which had to do with your
being rudely treated, a number of years ago, by a
member of the Board whose estate adjoined yours.
The churlish behavior of this member of the Board
was the cause of your refusal to place in the hands
of Dr. Burns, who had been selected to write
Brooke Hamilton’s biography, the data for the
biography,” the doctor stated in pleasant, impersonal
tones.</p>

<p class='c006'>“True enough so far as it goes,” Miss Susanna
acknowledged tersely. “The member of the Board
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>with whom I quarreled was Alec Carden. A greater
scamp never lived. We quarreled over Uncle
Brooke’s will. It seems a long long time ago.” She
gave an impatient little sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was before I accepted the presidency of Hamilton
College. I have been informed by the two
gentlemen, still serving on the Board, who were
members then, that it was a deplorable period for
the college during which the Board engaged in one
wrangle after another. They frankly criticized Mr.
Carden as having behaved more like an unscrupulous
politician than as became a dignified member of a
college board. I have never doubted but that your
grievance against the Board was sound.” The doctor
sat back in his chair and surveyed the little upright
figure in gray opposite him with one of his
encouraging, kindly smiles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, Doctor. The only way in which
I may show proper appreciation of your confidence
in me is to tell you the story from beginning to
end.” Miss Susanna sat very still for a moment
after her electrifying announcement. It was as
though she were trying to choose her words for a
beginning.</p>

<p class='c006'>An anticipatory silence hung over the president’s
office. Dr. Matthews awaited the revelation with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>profound relief. It would mark the laying of the
unwelcome ghost which had walked the campus all
these years. Marjorie found herself filled with an
odd kind of astonishment. She was at last to hear
the story which for years Miss Hamilton had stubbornly
locked behind her lips.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE REAL GUARDIAN OF HAMILTON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Alec Carden was a man of middle age when
I was a young woman.” Miss Susanna’s characteristically
brusque tones shattered the brief silence.
“He had never liked Uncle Brooke, simply because
Uncle Brooke was upright and he was not. Neither
had my uncle liked him. As an older man of wide
experience Uncle Brooke once or twice advised Alec
Carden against certain enterprises in which he had
engaged. Each time the advice was flouted. Carden
chose to regard him as an interfering old meddler.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uncle Brooke made his will years before he died.
He never changed it. From the time he built Hamilton
College he knew precisely what was important
to its welfare. He knew, too, what would be best
for it in time to come. He went over the will with
me, often and carefully. He was determined that
I should thoroughly understand every clause of it.”
Every sentence of the old lady’s narrative fell clear-cut
from her lips.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“He had divided his wealth, which was very great,
equally between me and the college, aside from a
few bequests to the servants and a special legacy
to Jonas. He used to say to me whimsically, on
occasion: ‘I’ve already given my college a large fortune,
Susanna, and I’ve only given you a home and
a little spending money. But you can get along
with a little, and my college cannot. Besides, I’m
here to look after you. When I’m gone, it’s you
and my college; share and share alike.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Susanna,” Marjorie spoke as the old lady
paused briefly, “may I please put that in the biography?”
Forgotten for the moment were all her misgivings.
She was not thinking of herself as biographer.
She was desirous that such valuable matter
should not be left out of the biography itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So you’ve decided to make the best of it,”
laughed the old lady. “Oh, I knew what I was
doing when I chose you as his biographer. Since
I’ve surrendered, I’ve surrendered unconditionally.
I wish the world to know his little quirks and turns,
his fancies and his whimsies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is indeed a pleasure to contemplate the thought
of Miss Dean as Brooke Hamilton’s biographer,”
gallantly supplemented President Matthews.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thank you both.” Marjorie’s sunshiny smile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>flashed briefly forth. It faded, leaving her beautiful
features unusually grave. “Perhaps hearing
these delightful personal memories of him will give
me the inspiration to do him justice,” she said very
humbly. “I can only try to write his story. If I
fail—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can’t fail,” broke in Miss Hamilton. “There
is no such word as fail in your vocabulary.” She
reached out and patted Marjorie’s arm. “Now you
and the doctor are to listen to a letter of instruction
which Uncle Brooke gave me, sealed, a year
before he died.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She took from a morocco handbag a letter, held
it up and pointed to the superscription: “‘For Susanna.
Not to be opened until after my death:’”
she read. She drew the letter from its envelope. “I
prefer to read it to you,” she explained. “You may
examine it afterward as much as you like.” She
began:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Susanna</span>:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have just come from an afternoon spent with
Mr. Walpole, my lawyer. I have arranged with him
in a codicil certain matters pertaining to Hamilton
College. I must now acquaint you with these. You
must be fitly equipped to carry out my wishes in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>regard to my college when I have gone on to a
world of blessed fulfillment, which can never be here.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I love my college, Susanna. Because I love it
I must leave nothing undone to safeguard its welfare.
My ancestors left me the land. I gave the
site, my money erected the buildings, endowed the
college. My brain, heart and mind acted as one
in bringing beauty to the campus. It is the child
of my heart, Susanna. It must not, shall not depart
from the near perfection to which I have raised
it. I have gloried in the spirit of democracy that
has developed among the students as a result of my
own thoughtful planning. But the past three years
have marked a change. A certain element of arrogance
and false pride has stolen into the college
with the enrollment of a few students who come
from homes of affluence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The present Board are not in favor of conducting
Hamilton College on the basis of nobility which
I believe should be particularly the foundation of
an institution of learning. They are desirous of
commercializing the campus. They are possessed to
ruin its natural beauty by dotting it thickly with
ornate halls and houses. Such as these for the
accommodation of a few students who can afford
to pay extravagant prices for board and lodging.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>These sordid schemers are eager to take advantage
of the fact that I have fitted and endowed Hamilton
magnificently. They intend to put their stupid, ignoble
ideas into force as soon as I am gone. I
overheard one of them say to another at a Board
meeting not long ago: ‘When he is out of the running
we shall have a free sweep.’ They imagine
that with my death Hamilton College will achieve
freedom from the direction of a Hamilton, and with
it a vast fortune. The board dreams of unlimited
power to spend my money, and with no restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are to assume my responsibility, Susanna.
It is a great deal to ask of you. But to whom else
can I turn? You know I have divided my wealth
between you and the college. Its half of the inheritance
may be distributed to the Board as a
whole, or in payments; at your discretion. Nothing
is to be either added or taken away from the campus
without your consent. You are to retain the right
to administrate my estate as you are convinced
would be pleasing to me. The fees of the college
are never to be increased. With Mr. Walpole you
will find complete directions in regard to the offering
of various scholarships which I have arranged
to be offered in the course of time. I have also left,
with him certain other welfare plans for the college.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>It will be your task to fulfill these for me
should the Messenger come for me before I have
had the time and opportunity to act.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Never allow the Board to intimidate you or beat
you down.</i> It is the old story of the man who took
home the frozen viper and warmed it, only to find
that when life returned to it it had no will save to
sting. So it is with the very men I have helped
to present membership of the Board. There will
one day be bitter resentment when these same men
learn that I have protected Hamilton College against
their vandalism. Remember, Susanna, resentment
can break no bones; neither can it change that which
was written to remain unchanged. I feel more at
ease since I have written this to you. I rely upon
your pride as a Hamilton, your loyalty and your
good judgment to uphold the work of my hands.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“A letter in keeping with what we have known
of Brooke Hamilton before today,” was the president’s
thoughtful attribute to the founder of Hamilton
College.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was his mind in the matter. By it you can
understand the situation as it was then better than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>from an explanation of it on my part,” rejoined
Miss Hamilton. “It remains for me to tell you
what happened between the Board and me after
Uncle Brooke had passed away. Mr. Walpole appointed
a day and hour for the reading of the will
at the Arms. The Board attended the reading to
a member in the interest of Hamilton College. They
raised a hub-hub immediately they learned that
Uncle Brooke had secured the college against their
commerciality.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alec Carden was infuriated. He lost his temper,
shook a fist in Mr. Walpole’s and my face and
shouted that no fool of a girl should stand between
the college and its rights. He rushed from the house
shouting: ‘I’ll find a way to break that fool will!’”
Miss Susanna’s eyes flashed as she recalled the affront.
“All but two of the Board members hurried
after him. William Graves and Caleb Frazer had
taken no part in the fuss. They had been true
friends of Uncle Brooke’s. They assured Mr. Walpole
and me of their regret in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Afterward, they refused to discuss the unfortunate
incident with anyone,” commented Dr. Matthews.
“This I learned from Doctor Burns. They
were his staunch supporters during his long service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>as president of Hamilton College. The doctor had
a great deal of trouble with Mr. Carden.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am aware of that,” nodded Miss Susanna. “It
was frequently remarked in the borough that how
Alec Carden managed to keep himself on the college
Board was a mystery. He was a violent man.
He quarreled disgracefully with both of his sons.
One of them stuck to him and inherited Carden
Hedge when his father died. The other took a
package of bonds which belonged to him from the
family safe and ran off to California. He changed
his name, so the story goes, engaged in a lucky
speculation and grew rich. He never came back
to Carden Hedge. His father never saw him again,
though he wrote him repeatedly to come home.
Alec died of apoplexy. Indulging in one of his
fits of rage, he had a seizure. John Carden still
lives at the Hedge, off and on. He turned out as
disagreeable as was his father. Peter was a multimillionaire
at last accounts of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alec Carden kept his word. He tried to break
the will and have the codicil set aside. Just when
I needed his help most Mr. Walpole died. Then I
engaged Richard Garrett, a young lawyer, but very
brilliant. He stood between me and Carden’s worst
attacks. But I had plenty of disagreeable scenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>with Alec Carden and his Board sympathizers. They
got it through their scheming heads at last that
Uncle Brooke had been too wise for them. Then
they tried to patch up their quarrel with me and
wheedle me into letting them have their own way
about things. I soon sent them all about their business.
From that time it was war to the knife between
us. I refused ever to admit the belligerents
to the Arms or to meet them elsewhere in the interests
of college business. All checks for disbursements
and papers were forwarded to me by Richard
Garrett.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At the beginning of my trouble with Carden I
had talked with Doctor Burns about the writing of
Uncle Brooke’s biography. Uncle Brooke had
greatly liked the doctor. I wished him to undertake
the biography. Before I had collected the
data for it I got into the thick of the fight with
Carden and the Board. Carden circulated calumnious
reports about Uncle Brooke. Uncle Brooke had
been a miser; he had made his fortune in slave
trading in the South Seas. He had also been suspected
of piracy on the high seas. He had commanded
South American filibustering expeditions.
It was grossly false; outrageous. And all because
he had been in the exporting business in China.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Such reports reached the students of Hamilton
College. I came in for very brutal criticism from
the girls there. I could not go for a walk along
the highway without meeting some of them and encountering
everything from covert to open ridicule.
So I came to despise those whom he had wished
me to like. The story’s almost done.” Miss Susanna’s
face, shadowed by the sorrow of the past,
brightened beautifully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I still intended that Doctor Burns should begin
the biography until one day Alec Carden and I met
on the highway near the Arms. He stopped me
and said I would be sorry if I attempted to publish
a biography of Uncle Brooke. He threatened to
follow it with what he declared would be a true
story of ‘my sneak uncle’s pirate doings in the East.’
He said he had gathered enough information against
him to make a most interesting pamphlet which he
intended to have printed and published at his own
expense to follow the biography. He was as explosive
in his talk as usual. He declared that Doctor
Burns was in sympathy with <i>him</i>, not me; that
he had merely consented to write the biography to
keep in my good graces. There was a chance that
I might be flattered into turning over to the Board
the authority they lacked.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“I did not believe a word he said. I told him so.
I went straight to the Arms and wrote to Doctor
Burns.” The old lady paused. She brought one
small hand down over the other with a sharp little
smack. “I never received an answer to that letter.
I wrote him two others. One I sent to him at this
office.” She glanced about the large pleasant room.
“The other I sent by Jonas to his campus residence.
He was away at the time, but his secretary, a young
man, promised to give it to him as soon as he returned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I had been ignored by him a third time,
I closed my heart against Hamilton College, forever,
as I thought. I could not conceive of how a
man like Doctor Burns could be in sympathy with
Carden’s cheap villainy. Still, I had given him an
opportunity to clear himself and he had made no
sign. He was therefore not the one to write Uncle
Brooke’s biography, and I knew no one else whom
I considered qualified to do so. It was not until
years afterward, quite by accident, that I learned
that Alec Carden’s nephew was Doctor Burns’ secretary
at that time. Then it was too late. The
years had passed, and Doctor Burns with them. I
believe now that he never received the letters I wrote
him.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“I am sure he did not,” Doctor Matthews said
quickly. “I am convinced that he had no knowledge
of such a calumnious pamphlet as Mr. Carden
threatened to have published. He attributed your
failure to bring forward the data for the biography
as the result of your having had an altercation with
the Board. He was not in sympathy with the Board.
You had asked him to write the biography of your
great uncle. He preferred to await your pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He died not more than a year before Alec Carden.”
Miss Susanna’s usually crisp tones were
tinged with melancholy. “And he never knew!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie had sat listening to the last of the
Hamilton’s story, a lovely, absorbed figure. Her
vivid imagination had visualized Miss Susanna as
she had probably been in girlhood. Across her brain
flashed the dramatic scenes which had occurred between
Miss Susanna and the hated Alec Carden.
Here was a real story infinitely more fascinating
than one which was the product of imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think I never knew of a more deplorable misunderstanding.”
There was poignant regret in Doctor
Matthews’ assertion. “We have, however one
thing for which to give thanks. No calumnious
word was ever published against the memory of
Brooke Hamilton. Yet, if you had found the opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to talk with Doctor Burns, he would have
advised you to go boldly ahead with the biography.
I would say the same today in a similar situation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that is precisely the point for which I blame
myself!” the old lady cried out regretfully. “I
should never have given up until I had seen the
doctor. I have read Uncle Brooke’s letters and
journals, over and over. They are the essence of
truth. No slanderous reports could live beside them.
I know that now. But I was young then, and alone
in a great empty castle. I was more or less bewildered
by the responsibility which had become
mine. I despised Alec Carden, and I was full to
the brim of Hamilton pride. I had never talked
with Uncle Brooke about the biography. It was
an issue that came to the fore after his passing.
When I had been rebuffed, as I thought, three times,
I retreated into my shell and stayed there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are out of it, forever, and ever!” Marjorie
exclaimed, her brown eyes beaming luminous
warmth on the wistful old face of the mistress of
the Arms. “You’ve been out of it a good many
times in the past two years, too. All the years you
were tucked away in it you were true to the trust
Mr. Brooke Hamilton placed in you. You felt
that you hated his college, but you guarded its welfare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>just as faithfully as though you had loved it.
You are the most amazing person in the whole world,
Miss Susanna. You’re the real guardian of Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And now, Marvelous Manager, you and I will
continue our walk on the campus.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was almost four by the chimes clock on Hamilton
Hall when Marjorie and Miss Susanna issued
from the president’s house, arm in arm. Neither
would ever forget that wonderful afternoon. It
marked for Miss Susanna the re-union with a valued
friend of long ago—Hamilton College. For Marjorie
it marked the answering of a most perplexing
question. She believed buoyantly that with the answer
was bound to come a new era of fellowship
on the campus, far greater than had ever before
manifested itself among the students.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t really believe it’s true, Miss Susanna,”
she said happily; “that you and I are actually walking
together across the campus. I feel as though,
all of a sudden; whisk! there’d come a magic wind
and you’d disappear and I’d wake up to find myself
walking along alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Not quite so bad as that. Let me tell you, I’m
very real.” Miss Susanna gave Marjorie’s arm an
only half gentle pinch. “There,” she said, “was
that hard enough to convince you that I am not a
campus sprite. I’m a crabbed old woman, ready to
pinch if the occasion demands it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m glad as can be you are real. I’m glad I
know more now of how splendid you are than ever
I knew before. I’m glad you’d rather have your
own Marvelous Manager write the biography than
even Prexy Matthews. I’m glad you have at last
condescended to come and see me.” Marjorie had
begun enthusiastically, gathering more enthusiasm
as she rushed from one gladness on to another. She
ended with a satisfied little exhalation of breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are a compendium of gladnesses, child.”
Miss Hamilton smiled very tenderly at the glowing,
graceful girl at her side. “Well, it is good to be here;
to walk the old green again, even though it isn’t
very green at present. I used to love the campus,
Marjorie. I experienced a queer little thrill that day
when you told me your best friend at Hamilton was
the campus. I loved it in the same way when I
was a student here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you never told me you were a graduate of
Hamilton,” Marjorie lightly reproached. She stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>short on the campus. “I think you ought to
be pinched on that account.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never asked me where I was educated,”
Miss Susanna replied, chuckling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I always meant to. Somehow I never did.”
Marjorie looked reflective. “You see, at first, I
never felt you would like me to ask you any personal
questions. After I came to know you well
we had so many other things to talk about I never
again thought of asking you. That must be the
reason.” She gave a positive little nod.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It must be,” the old lady agreed half jestingly.
“I know that I used to be afraid you would say or
do something, when first you came to the Arms to
see me, that might cause me to dislike you. But
you never did until the day we fell out about that
snip of a girl who tried to run her car over me. I
was a pig-headed, obstinate old chump that day,
child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no you weren’t. Now I <i>shall</i> pinch you for
calling yourself names.” Marjorie affectionately
made good her threat. “I’m going to keep on with
these crab-like nips until you promise never to mention
such ancient history again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had no idea you were such a bully. I’ll have
to pretend good behavior. I never supposed anyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>would care if I called myself disrespectful
names,” giggled the amused old lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never know what may happen,” Marjorie
blithely told her. “Look, Miss Susanna.” She
pointed out a mammoth elm tree just ahead of them
at their right. “That’s my favorite campus tree.
During the spring and summer, until late in the
fall, there are seats placed underneath it. Whenever
I find a few minutes to relax and be downright
lazy, I steer straight for that tree. Jerry calls it
the Bean tree and the seats the Bean holders. She
says all Bean supporters belong to the genus Bean.
Hence the name Bean holders.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie continued to entertain Miss Susanna in
this gay strain as she proudly conducted her across
the campus and toward Wayland Hall. On the
stone walk leading up to the Hall the distinguished
visitor halted for a prolonged look around.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The same old Hall,” she half sighed. “I’ve lived
for years almost in sight of it without having once
seen it. I’ve cared for it more than the others because
he liked it so well. And I never even suspected
why he cared until I went over some of his
papers after he died. You’ll read the story for
yourself, Marjorie, when you come to the Arms
to stay with me and write the biography. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>do you think that will be, child?” she questioned,
an eager, hungry light leaping into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I—I don’t know, Miss Susanna.” Marjorie
looked concerned. “Not really to stay, perhaps, before
spring. When we come back from Sanford
after the holidays I’ll try to come almost every afternoon
to the Arms. I’ll stay until about nine o’clock
in the evening. Promise to give me my dinner,
and plenty of it, O, Lady of the Arms? I’m always
ravenous when dinner time comes.” She
merrily endeavored to stave off disappointment
from Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may have a dozen dinners every night since
that is all you demand,” the old lady assured with
reckless hospitality. The slight shadow, called to
her features by Marjorie’s first doubtful words of
reply, faded instantly. “‘Half a loaf is better than
no bread,’” she quoted with a kind of resigned content.
“I hope you and Jerry will be able to settle
down with me at the Arms by the first of March.
I’d like you to see spring awaken at the old place.
It is a memorable experience; to live and breathe
with the return of spring in a beauty spot like Hamilton
Arms. I look forward to and pass through it
each year with wonder and gratitude toward my
Creator,” she ended reverently.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“I promise you, Jerry and I will surely be with
you at the Arms to greet the spring,” Marjorie declared
impulsively, imbued with the inspiration of
her elderly friend’s deep sentiment. “It’s so comforting
to know that Jerry is to come to the Arms
with me. I’d hate so to leave her to room alone.
The other girls would baby her and rush her if I
were not at the Hall. She would miss me dreadfully,
only she would try not to let me or anyone
else know it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jerry can keep Jonas and me amused and in
good humor,” Miss Susanna said humorously. “I
expect to enjoy her company hugely while you are
tucked demurely away in the study, living over life
at Hamilton as Uncle Brooke found it. I shall make
Jerry help me organize a grand social campaign.
We’ll have the Travelers, old and new, here often
to dinner and tea. And we’ll entertain the dormitory
girls some fine spring afternoon and evening.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie drew a long, ecstatic breath. “Oh,
splendid!” she cried. “It’s simply one glorious good
fortune piled on another for the Travelers, Miss
Susanna.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You forget how much more it means to me.
I am a greater gainer than the Travelers. I’m still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>looking strictly out for my own interest,” was the
half joking reminder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you!” Marjorie gave the arm she held a
playful shake. “I wish you felt it was strictly to
your interest to go with me to Room 15, Wayland
Hall, to visit Jeremiah and me this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her inflection was wistfully coaxing. On the
afternoon previous, Miss Susanna had announced,
that, on the following afternoon she and Marjorie
would together call upon President Matthews. Marjorie
had then joyfully urged her to take tea afterward
in Room 15, Wayland Hall, at a jollification in
honor of her. The mistress of the Arms had refused,
saying rather pessimistically that she doubted
if she would be in the humor for a social tea after
her interview with the president of Hamilton College.
She promised instead to walk across the
campus as far as Wayland Hall. She declared
musingly that she would like to have a good look
at the Hall again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the momentous visit had been made and Miss
Susanna was apparently in a very delightful humor.
Marjorie could not resist the golden opportunity
of making a last coaxing plea.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have changed my mind about not going to
your room with you, Marvelous Manager,” the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>lady announced, to Marjorie’s amazement. They
were still standing on the stone walk in front of
the Hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going to whisk you into the Hall before you
have time to change it again.” Marjorie took
resolute hold of the arm she had just gently shaken
and began hurriedly marching the last of the
Hamiltons up to the veranda.</p>

<p class='c006'>Already she was planning an impromptu reception
for her beloved guest. She hoped Miss Remson
would not answer her ring of the bell. She
frequently answered the bell if she chanced to be
downstairs when it rang. To summon Miss Remson
to Room 15, and have the manager and Miss
Susanna meet there should be one feature of the
reception. Tea should be another. She would levy
upon Leila for maccaroons from the five pound box
she had bought yesterday. Ronny still had plenty
of Mexican candied fruit on hand. Jerry should
be stripped of a precious glass jar of salted pecans.
She would ruthlessly commandeer the jar of blackberry
jam which Lucy had that morning received
from home, provided it hadn’t been devoured already.
There was always a supply of crackers,
saltine and soda, on hand in 15, she reflected comfortably.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Nellie, one of the maids, answered the bell. Marjorie
stretched forth a hand and conducted Miss
Susanna across the threshold in gallant fashion. An
impulse to tears rose within her as she saw an unbidden
sadness steal into her companion’s face the
moment she stepped into the old-fashioned hall. It
passed instantly. Miss Susanna poked her head into
the living room and remarked on its tasteful
furnishings in the most matter-of-fact tones.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I had dreamed that you would positively set
your magnificent foot in my kingdom today I would
have made elaborate preparations for you,” Marjorie
presently apologized, her hand on the door
knob of Room 15. “As it is, I’ll have to seat you in
state in my best easy chair and rush Jerry out for
Leila, Vera and the rest of the Sanfordites. There
are certainly going to be some decidedly surprised
Travelers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>In the very next minute there was one decidedly
surprised Traveler. As Marjorie stepped after Miss
Susanna into her room a rising tide of jubilant
sound assailed her ears.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hamilton, Hamilton, staunch and true:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Great Brooke Hamilton founded you.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Great Brooke Hamilton—that’s his name!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Great Brooke Hamilton—sound his fame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Twice the merry company shouted out this welcome.
Miss Susanna laughingly acknowledged the
honor done her with a flourish of small hands and
many bobbing bows. Far from showing surprise at
the festal scene into which she and Marjorie had
walked she irradiated only chuckling amusement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Empress of Wayland Hall has already arrived
and been conducted to her place on the throne.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Ronny tripped to the middle of the room with this
announcement as soon as the hub-bub attending the
new Hamilton yell had subsided. She was attired
in a green velvet page’s costume which she had confiscated
from a trunk in the attic. Her fair features
were animated with mischievous light as she went
through a kind of ceremonious dance before Miss
Susanna. She gracefully beckoned the old lady to
the throne and grandiosely pointed out the middle
vacant place on it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is all this about?” demanded Marjorie.
She grandly waved Ronny off when the latter returned
from escorting Miss Hamilton to the throne
to perform the same kind office for her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ask no questions, pretty maid, but gently follow
your leader,” was Ronny’s lofty advice. “You are
about to be ranked with royalty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall remain a commoner all the rest of my
life unless you explain some of this thusness,” defied
Marjorie threateningly with an anything but
threatening expression. “How did <i>you</i> know Miss
Susanna was coming here today, when I didn’t?
How does Miss Remson happen to be here to meet
her? You never made up that dandy Hamilton yell
on the spur of the moment. Look at this room!
I know you’ve been fixing at it ever since I went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>out to meet Miss Susanna. You’re all conspirators,
the dearest, bestest, dandiest old plotters under the
sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>You’re</i> as guilty as they are.” She leveled an
accusing finger at Miss Hamilton. “You didn’t
know a thing about it last night. I guess a flock
of little birds flew over to the Arms this morning.
That would account for why you changed your
mind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a terrible tirade,” commented Ronny in
a shocked tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why don’t you introduce us to the royal party
you’ve just called down?” inquired Jerry, her cheerful
smile in evidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Judging from the preparations you’ve made for
her, I’d say you know her better than I,” was Marjorie’s
laughing rejoinder. “Now I’m going to do
something I’ve longed to do for two years. I’m
going to introduce the Empress of Wayland Hall to
the Lady of Hamilton Arms.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie walked up to the make-shift throne and
salaamed profoundly before it to its two occupants.
Then she lifted one of Miss Remson’s hands and
placed it in one of Miss Susanna’s. The crowd of
laughing girls had drawn close to the trio as she
did thus. “We love you both so much,” she said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in her clear enunciation. “I know you are friends
already.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Approving applause went up from the more
humble subjects. Their compact movement toward
the throne had not been without an object. Marjorie
felt herself suddenly seized and shoved into
the throne’s vacant left-hand place before she could
make the least resistance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now will you be good?” Muriel Harding threatened
the flushed giggling addition to royalty. “Don’t
fail to notice that I am hanging over you with my
most menacing air.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You look about as menacing as a peaceful sheep,”
Lillian Wenderblatt promptly criticized.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you had said a lamb I shouldn’t have minded.
I’m very certain I <i>do not</i> look like a sheep, peaceful
or ferocious,” Muriel asserted with vast dignity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A ferocious sheep,” pleasantly repeated Vera.
“How very entertaining; the idea, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, start on someone else. If you don’t treat
me with more respect I shall tell the royal party
what the throne’s made of,” warned Muriel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>I</i> could do that, but I won’t.” Marjorie beamed
knowingly at Jerry. “How you must have hustled,
Jeremiah Macy, to do all this.” A comprehensive
sweep of an arm not only included the throne, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>also the study table, flower-trimmed and set out
with a tea service. There were two gorgeous
bunches of roses, one on each chiffonier. Scattered
about the room was the pick of decorative treasures
from each Travelers’ room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I hustled a little bit. The girls did a lot,
too. After Leila and I called up Miss—” She
clapped her hand to her mouth in merry dismay.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So it <i>wasn’t</i> a flock of birds that told you.”
Marjorie bent a gaily disapproving glance upon Miss
Hamilton. “And I was the only one surprised of
all this crowd. I’m still more surprised at being
royalty. Would you mind mentioning my royal
title.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Royal Countess of Bean,” Jerry instantly
supplied. “I hope you like and appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll try to,” Marjorie promised with a plaintive
meekness which produced a gale of ready laughter
in which she joined.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Remson and Miss Susanna had clasped hands
and taken but one straight survey, each of the other,
before knowing that they were destined to pass
quickly from acquaintanceship to the estate of
friendship. “My girls,” as the old lady loved to
call the special little coterie to which Marjorie belonged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>would be the fragrant, youthful bond between
these two elder sisters of Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c006'>While royalty took its ease on a plumped-up
throne the hard working subjects of the imperial
trio prepared the feast. Leila made the tea, boastfully
asserting that no such tea had ever been made
before in the history of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My, <i>such</i> an equivocal statement! It might mean
either the best or the worst tea that was ever made,”
Kathie pointed out, grave as a judge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rather sweeping, <i>I</i> should say,” was Vera’s ironical
opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am not sorry I praised my own tea. Now I
know that nobody else would have done it,” Leila
remarked loudly to the teapot as she set it on the
table. “Even Midget has a grudge against my
sayings.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, never mind about Midget. I approve of
you and your sayings, Leila Greatheart,” consoled
Jerry. “Do say something to me now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I will.” Leila dropped into a brogue.
“I’ll be askin’ a favor of you, Jeremiah.” There
was a mirthful gleam in Leila’s blue eyes which
Jerry happened to miss. “Go to Marjorie’s closet
and bring out of it the box of maccaroons I placed
there a while ago.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Jerry obediently started for the closet. Her progress
was followed by several pairs of laughing eyes.
Leila watched her with an amused show of white
teeth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aa-h-h-h!” Jerry emitted a sharp yell and made
a headlong dive into the closet. She kicked the box
of maccaroons, which reposed on the closet floor at
her feet, nearly overturning it. She had forgotten
everything except the tall slender girl stowed away
in the closet whose unexpected appearance in such
a place had given her a startling surprise. Both
plump arms wound around Helen Trent. Jerry was
now giving a bear-like demonstration of affection.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Helen; good old Helen Trent!” she was crying
out in delight. “How long have you been lurking
in that closet? Come out of it, this instant.
Leila Harper put you there, of course. That’s why
she sent me for the maccaroons.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Fondly escorted by Jerry, Helen emerged from
Marjorie’s dress closet to become the center of attraction
in the room for the time being.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So glad to get out of that stuffy old closet,” she
sighed, with her ever attractive display of dimples.
“Leila told me to stay in there until she sent Jerry
to let me out. I could hear all of you talking. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>I wanted to butt in. For Jeremiah’s sake I was
noble and silent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cut out being noble and silent. Talk,” urged
Jerry. She was bubbling over with good cheer at
sight of pretty, easy-going Helen whose cheery disposition
was always toward the funny side of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will. First let me hug Marjorie and Miss Susanna.
I haven’t hugged them yet. Then do give
me some tea and a chair over which to drape my
weary frame.” Helen grew ridiculously pleading.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You talk like a one-piece dress,” Jerry snickered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well?” Helen lazily opened her limpid blue
eyes. “You know you didn’t specify as to the kind
of talk, Jeremiah. You simply said: ‘Talk.’ It’s
werry fatiguing, Jeremiah, to stand up indefinitely
in a dress closet. I don’t aspire to a seat on the
throne. I am too modest. I think your arm chair
might be nice.” Helen sent an ingratiating smile
to Muriel who was complacently occupying the
coveted arm chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll tip Muriel out immediately.” Jerry swaggered
over to the grinning occupant. “Vacate gracefully,
or be tipped out bodily?” she asked with dangerous
suavity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can’t tip me out of what I’m not in.” Muriel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>made an agile bound from the chair and dodged
Jerry’s reaching hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let Muriel have the chair. Take my place on
the throne, Helen. Miss Susanna wants to monopolize
you.” Marjorie came forward and escorted
Helen to the dais. Muriel instantly retrieved the
chair and jeered at Jerry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a wonder you didn’t see me when I came
in this morning,” Helen laughingly told Marjorie.
“I dodged into Miss Remson’s office just as you
came downstairs to go to the laboratory.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was too obliging to see what I wasn’t supposed
to,” Marjorie made jesting return. With her
usual love of action she began helping Leila serve the
tea. The spread was a lap collation with the guests
informally occupying, for the most part, cushions on
the floor. Paper napkins, paper plates and tea cups
balanced on knees were leading features. But Leila’s
tea was above reproach. The tiny toothsome sandwiches
made by Ronny and Vera disappeared like
magic. Ellen’s famous caramel cake was delicious
as ever and the salted nuts, olives and cheese straws
appetizing relishes.</p>

<p class='c006'>None of the effervescently gay company in 15 was
enjoying the party more hugely than Miss Susanna.
She ate the delectable fare offered her with hungry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>heartiness, drank two cups of tea; laughed and
chatted with the happy abandon of girlhood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Because she loved these girls who had loved her
and revered the memory of her kinsman, the once-prejudiced,
only living representative of a grand
old colonial family, suddenly experienced a new and
overwhelming sympathy toward all girlhood. Little
by little the rusting bars of prejudice had worn
away against the friendly assaults of “her girls.”
For that she owed girlhood a debt which she purposed
to pay.</p>

<p class='c006'>More than once as her eyes strayed to Marjorie,
to rest with content on the young girl’s glowing,
sunshiny face she was reminded of the lines of a
favorite old song. She found exquisite happiness
in fitting the worshipping words to Marjorie.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Bean, there is nothing like efficiency. And
I am <i>so</i> efficient. I didn’t hear you say a thing.”
Jerry cupped a hand to an ear and eyed Marjorie
hopefully. Marjorie was frowningly occupied with
a page of maddeningly abstruse French. “I certainly
have worked hard at this schedule.” Jerry
continued her self-laudatory remarks. “But the results
are <i>celostrous</i>, Bean; <i>simply celostrous</i>! Ha!
I thought my new word would prove irresistible!”
she exclaimed in triumph as Marjorie looked up in
mild surprise at Jerry’s latest coining.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something sounded new and queer,” Marjorie
averred with the gurgling little laugh Jerry liked
to hear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now that I have your attention, never mind
about my new descriptive adjective. I’ve been
frisking gaily about the room, dropping things on
the floor, growling as I picked them up. And why?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>On purpose to be noticed by you. Seeing you’re
now seeing me, may I venture to ask if you know
the reason for my nice new adjective?” Jerry pursued
blandly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never heard you frisk a single frisk, Jeremiah,
or drop a single drop, or growl a single growl. This
page of French is awful! It’s an odd old religious
argument between two Norman priests. I’d say it
couldn’t be lucidly translated into English, but it
can, or we wouldn’t be stuck with it for a study.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go and ask her frozenness, the Ice Queen, to
give you a lift,” innocently proposed Jerry. “Muriel
says she is a wonder in French. Due to having had
a French governess ever since she could hot-foot it
around the nursery.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’d like to ask her about this very thing,” sighed
Marjorie. “If I wanted to know about it for someone
else I suppose I might. I don’t feel inclined to
go to her on my own account.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I get you, Bean. Don’t take my advice. I
wouldn’t take it myself. You could ask Muriel to
ask her about it. That ain’t no way to do, either.”
She shook a reproving head at herself in her dressing
table mirror in front of which she had paused
to fluff and pat her hair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This translation would really be a good excuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>for going to see Miss Monroe,” Marjorie reflected
aloud. “I wonder what she will do during the holidays?
She told Muriel she had no friends in the
United States besides the Hamilton girls she knows.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose she includes Leslie Hob-goblin Cairns
among the Hamilton aggregation.” Jerry swung
disdainfully around from the mirror.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Um-m; probably.” Marjorie sat chin in hand,
staring ruminatively at Jerry. “Leslie Cairns may
ask Miss Monroe to spend Christmas with her,”
she advanced after a moment’s silence. “I don’t
mean in the town of Hamilton, at the Hamilton
Hotel. I mean away from there; New York or
Philadelphia, or even Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She may have asked her long before this.” Jerry
spoke rather impatiently. “Suppose she hasn’t, Marvelous
Manager?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then some of us should take her home with us,”
Marjorie said with conviction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uh-h-h-h. I knew it,” Jerry groaned. “But it
can’t be you, and it won’t be me. At least I hope
it won’t. You ought not attempt to entertain Miss
Susanna at Castle Dean and run a welfare bureau
there at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re positively outrageous, Jeremiah, but
there’s fatal truth in what you say,” Marjorie smiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>at Jerry’s humorous injunction. “It would complicate
things to have Miss Monroe visit me while Miss
Susanna is at the castle. I am so anxious, for Miss
Susanna’s sake, to have the perfect spirit of Christmas
in the house. Leila, Vera and Robin will help
it along, but Miss Monroe wouldn’t. There’d be a
strain on everything that would spoil all the joy
and dearness of Yuletide. It would worry General
and Captain. I—I couldn’t do it and be fair to
them.” The laughter had died out of her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you know she’d come if you asked her?”
quizzed Jerry. “It’s only recently that she’s discovered
you are on the college map. She hasn’t
discovered me yet. Can you blame me for not being
crazy to welcome her to the Macy’s humble hut?
Suppose I did, and she fell in love with Hal? I’d
have put myself in line for the lasting reproach of
an injured brother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a nonsensical goose.” Marjorie felt her
face grow rosy at mention of Hal Macy. She was
provoked with herself for blushing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suspect it, but you’ve said it. Nothing can be
done about it either.” Jerry drew a chair up to
the study table. She sat down opposite Marjorie,
leaned her elbows on it in imitation of her chum
and stared at Marjorie with a refulgent smile. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>drew from a pocket of her serge dress a little blue
book. “Every blessed thing we have to do, person
we have to see, or place we have to go on the campus
within the next ten days is down in this book,” she
said with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, let me see it!” Marjorie reached out eagerly
for the book. She examined it with growing enthusiasm.
“It’s a treasure, Jerry. How did you
happen to think of doing it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Past sad experience, my child. I’m growing
old.” Jerry gave a muffled sob. “I can’t rush
around and do ten days pre-Christmas celebrating,
shopping, calling, and get away with it, all within
three hours before train time. This lovely schedule
includes everything and everybody who it is up to
us to include on the campus.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s—” Marjorie paused: “celostrous,” she said
with a laugh. “There, Jeremiah, I remembered your
new adjective. If we stick to that program we’ll
be wonders. If we half stick to it we’ll avoid a rush
at the last minute. I’m so glad the dormitory girls
are beautifully taken care of. That was another
of your inspirations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the evening following Miss Susanna’s visit to
Wayland Hall the original Travelers had held a
meeting in Leila’s and Vera’s room. Its purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>was to discuss what should be done in the way of
Christmas entertainment on the campus for the students
who expected to remain in college during
holidays. Persistent scouting for two weeks previous
among the students, by both chapters of the
Travelers, had established the fact that not more
than a dozen girls on the campus would spend the
holidays at Hamilton College. Again the dormitory
girls became the main problem for consideration.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jerry had solved the problem by proposing that
each Traveler should make herself responsible for
the holiday amusement of two dormitory girls.
“Find out what they’d like to do over the holidays
and then help them do it,” she had advised. “Some
will want to spend Christmas in the city. Others
would probably love to be invited to spend the holidays
in the kind of homes we have, where there is
lots of Christmas cheer. I’ll take four dorms home
with me. Let me hear from the rest of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Hailing Jerry’s suggestion with the good will
attending the season, Page and Dean, the dormitory
girls’ main stand-bys, called a meeting of the
“dorms” in Greek Hall and electrified the off-campus
girls with their unexpected proposal. Before the
favored company of students left Greek Hall each
had confided either to Robin or Marjorie her choice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>in regard to how she would prefer to spend the
Christmas vacation. Fifteen of the dormitory girls
had already made plans to spend the holidays at
their own homes or those of friends. Forty of them
wistfully declared for the joy of a family Christmas,
but demurred in the same breath as being
“afraid of causing too much work and trouble for
others.” The comparatively small remainder consisted
of the more independent and adventurous
contingent of “dorms” who welcomed the experience
of seeing New York, Philadelphia or Washington,
D. C., the three cities among which they
were given choice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leila, Vera, Kathie, Helen, Robin, Phil Moore
and Barbara Severn were among the Travelers Sanford
bound. Leila, Vera and Robin were to be Marjorie’s
guests as well as Miss Susanna. Kathie was
to be Lucy’s company. Helen fell to Jerry, who
would also entertain the four dorms. Ronny had
arranged to go to Miss Archer. Phil and Barbara
would share her hospitality. So would two of the
dormitory girls. Lucy had also invited Anna Towne
and Verna Burkett. She was highly edified at the
prospect of entertaining three girls instead of one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jerry’s whole-souled proposal had now been successfully
carried out so far as the preliminaries of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>choice went. It now remained to the Travelers,
original and of the new branch of the sorority, to
look out for the off-campus girls who longed for
a home-like Christmas. As seven of the Travelers
themselves were to be guests of the Sanford girls
they could not be counted upon, therefore, to furnish
the holiday pleasures of home to the dormitory girls.
They did their part by taking upon themselves the
financing of the modest city expeditions planned
by the off-campus girls. Nor would they allow their
chums to contribute a penny toward it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You heard what I said, Jerry Macy.” Marjorie
suddenly bounced up from her chair and made
one of her funny, little-girl rushes at Jerry. “Don’t
pretend you didn’t.” She pounced upon Jerry,
threatening: “I’m going to muss up your hair, since
you took so much trouble to fix it. The only way
you can save your nice fluffy coiffure is to say: ‘Yes,
Marjorie, it was another of my inspirations.’ You
may notice I don’t refer to my precious self as
‘Bean,’ either.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sorry, but I never could talk like you, Bean.”
To complete her defiance up went Jerry’s hands in
a backward reach. She caught Marjorie wrists. The
two girls were engaged in a friendly grapple when
the door opened and Muriel Harding came in, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>arms piled high with packages, her smart little hat
set far back on her head, two or three loosened
curling locks of hair hanging over her face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have we here?” Jerry demanded pleasantly.
“Just what one might expect would drift in
without knocking.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re doing the knocking now; why worry,”
chuckled Muriel. She walked over to Jerry’s couch
bed; dumped her packages upon it with a great sigh
of relief. “I made port at the front door with my
cargo beautifully, but I fell up two steps of the
stairs. You can see what a wreck it made of me.”
She sat down on the couch beside her bundles,
whipped off her hat and began tucking up her unruly
locks of bright hair. “Every last present that I intend
to buy for campus dwellers is in this heap,”
she declared with stress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is there anything for me there?” Jerry showed
sudden flattering interest in Muriel. “If so, let me
see it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, there’s nothing for you,” mimicked Muriel.
“I’m going to buy your Christmas present at home,
in the Sanford ten-cent store.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps we’ll meet there.” Jerry arched significant
brows. “I had thought of some nice little ten-cent
token for—” She made an effective pause.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“I didn’t come here to talk to you.” Muriel
tossed her head. “I came to see Marjorie. I’ve had
bad luck about my two Christmas dorms, Marvelous
Manager. The same nice thing has happened to
them both. Their families have sent them the money
to go home for the holidays. Neither of them had
expected any such good fortune. The rest of the
dorms have their plans all made. Not a single,
double, triple or quadruple dorm will grace the
would-be hospitable hearth of Harding. I’ll bet you
couldn’t make up a sentiment as effective as that,
Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A double dorm would be twins. A triple dorm
would be a freak. A quadruple dorm would constitute
material for a side-show,” was Jerry’s reflectively
satirical observation. “Oh, I forgot.
Kindly confine your conversation to Bean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go away, Jeremiah,” Muriel firmly requested.
“Go and see Ronny. A big box for her from California
is downstairs in the hall. Tell her I saw it
first and politely sent you to hand her the news. It
will show Ronny how helpful my disposition is.
You can square yourself with me at the same time.”
Muriel opened her eyes, showed her teeth and
bobbed her head at Jerry in what she termed her
“delighted” expression.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Tell her yourself; I’m no news herald.” Jerry
made no move to perform the squaring act Muriel
had suggested. In the next two minutes she changed
her mind and hustled to tell Ronny of the box.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I happen to remember that you are just the person
I want to talk to, Muriel,” Marjorie said. “Jerry
and I have been wondering what Miss Monroe is
going to do over the holidays. Last time I asked
you about her you hadn’t been able to find out her
plans. What do you know about them now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a blessed thing except this. She said yesterday
she might spend Christmas in New York. I
had asked her outright what she was going to do
over the holidays. It was inquisitive; maybe.”
Muriel shrugged her shoulders. “I knew you were
anxious to know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If she is going to New York, it means Leslie
Cairns has invited her. That’s too bad; after the
encouraging signs she’s shown lately of thawing toward
us.” Marjorie’s tone was rather gloomy. “It
will quash everything we’ve tried to do to draw
her away from Leslie Cairns. I’d invite her to go
home with me for the holidays, but I have Miss
Susanna to consider first of all. If I hadn’t, Miss
Monroe wouldn’t accept a Christmas invitation from
me,” Marjorie ended with a trace of self-mockery.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“To hear you talk one might think you were a
tabooed character.” Muriel’s gurgle of laughter
brought a smile to Marjorie’s troubled features.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I feel so cross sometimes when I think about
that aggravating girl.” Marjorie’s answer rang
with vexation. “I’ve not been in your room since
you came back to Hamilton. Neither has Ronny,
Jerry nor Lucy. She snubbed the four of us
thoroughly in the beginning. Now proper pride
won’t allow us to put ourselves in direct line for
further snubs. She’s been fairly nice to Robin. Yet
Robin hasn’t cared to try calling on Miss Monroe
yet. She doesn’t wish to risk a snubbing, now that
she’s made a little headway with our enchanted
princess.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I could like her if she’d let me,” Muriel said
bluntly. “We don’t meet often in the room except
just before old ten-thirty, and in the morning. We’re
both out a good deal. She is brilliant or she couldn’t
cut study the way she does and not be conditioned.”
There was a hint of admiration in Muriel’s observation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh-h!” Marjorie swung round in her chair until
she was facing Muriel. “Why couldn’t—I wonder
if you—It doesn’t seem fair to ask you, Muriel,
but, since both the dorms have gone back on you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>would you care to ask Miss Monroe to go home
with you for Christmas?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie fairly held her breath as she finished
asking the question. This splendid way of helping
the strange, beautiful girl in whom she had become
so thoroughly interested she was inclined to
regard as a positive dispensation of a kindly Providence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I might.” Muriel stared contemplatively at the
anxious questioner. “I was so disappointed when
my two dorms flivvered and renounced me I never
thought of my old friend the Ice Queen.” She
looked rather sheepish then smirked at Marjorie and
said: “‘Charity begins at home.’ If I mentioned
Charity in my invitation to the Ice Queen, br-r-r,
she’d freeze Matchless Muriel solid at one glance.
Then I couldn’t go home for Christmas. Neither
could she go with me. Think how sad it would be!
Two cold, shiny, slippery, glittery Ice Queens, friz
solid over the holidays.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Giggling at her own weird fancy, Muriel rose and
began gathering up her packages. “I’ll ask her
directly, if she’s home, dear Bean. I’ll let you know
as soon as I can escape from her royal presence to
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a darling, and the most obliging person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>in the universe. If you’d said you’d rather not ask
her, I shouldn’t have blamed you in the least. I
thought, after the idea popped into my head, that I
ought to ask you for Miss Monroe’s sake,” was
Marjorie’s honest avowal. “Let me give you a
basket to put your stuff in. Here’s the laundry
basket.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie proceeded to stack the piles of clean
laundry on the couch and place Muriel’s packages in
the basket instead. The two girls performed the
little task with the usual amount of light talk and
laughter. After Muriel had gone Marjorie sat down
again at the table to indulge in a kindly little daydream
which had to do with helping Muriel entertain
Doris Monroe should she become Muriel’s
Christmas guest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jerry presently drifted into the room to announce
that Ronny had cruelly refused to unpack the box
from California before her and Lucy. “She made
us help her upstairs with it, then she coldly turned
us out.” Jerry complained plaintively. “I’d have
raged like a gale at such treatment only she gave me
some Mexican candied fruit. It was very celostrous.
My new adjective just describes the candied banana
I had. What became of Matchless Muriel? I see
she’s beaten it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“She’ll return presently,” Marjorie made mysterious
answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was fully an hour afterward before Muriel
suddenly popped into the room, closing the door
quickly but soundlessly after her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Excuse my conspirator entrance,” she began just
above a whisper. “I didn’t care to have the Ice
Queen know where I went. I ducked out of our
room without saying a word. I promised to tell
you what she said, Marjorie, to our plan.” Muriel’s
eyes were bright with the importance of her information.
“Don’t turn all colors with surprise. She
says she’ll go to Sanford with me for Christmas.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>UNFLATTERING COMPARISON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>While Marjorie Dean and Muriel Harding had
been earnestly discussing a welfare invitation for
difficult Doris Monroe, the latter had been spending
a couple of very disagreeable hours with Leslie
Cairns. Leslie had seen fit to assume the particularly
dictatorial air which of all her category of unpleasant
moods Doris most thoroughly detested.</p>

<p class='c006'>To begin with Leslie had come to meet Doris at
the Colonial fresh from a hot argument with the
Italian, Sabatini, whom she had seen fit to call on
at his garage and scathingly upbraid for being a
“cheating dago quitter.” Leslie argued that, for
the amount of money she had paid Sabatini he should
have stood out against the threats of Signor Baretti
and declined to put the busses back into service.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are no lady, but the creza girl; thick head
you have,” Sabatini had finally shouted at Leslie
when his temper broke all bounds. “You are the
foolish. I don’ run the busses when Baretti say I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>must, I get my franchisa take from me. Then don’
run, anyhow. You get that through your head, you
can.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then give back part of that money, and cut out
the pet names,” Leslie had blazed back at him.
“You’ll find out who you’re talking to, you thieving
dago, before you are many weeks older. I’ll
<i>break you</i>. Put you out of business. <i>Just like that!</i>”
Leslie had given her usual imitation of what she
fondly believed would have been her father’s way
of dealing with the situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a matter of fact her father, Peter Cairns,
would never have figured personally in any such
affair. He would have placed it in the hands of a
subordinate below his rank as financier, who would
have in turn detailed his subordinate to act and so
on down until one competent to deal with the Italian
had been secured.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie was not ignorant of her father’s methods
of procedure but she was ambitious to prove her
own power over people and circumstances. She was
determined to prove to her father that she could
bring about any consummation she desired either
by her own clever maneuvering or by force of will.
Her idea of will power was—“make other people do
as you say.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Sabatini’s parting, furious speech had been: “You
try make troubla I make you the troubla, too. You
see. I tell about you to the paper man. Everabuddy
read ’bout you in the paper.” He had already refused
to return a penny of the money she had given
him. Leslie’s humor as she lounged out of the garage
with an air of lofty indifference was ferocious.</p>

<p class='c006'>This had been her third and most trying interview
with the Italian, Sabatini, since the busses had
again begun to run. She reflected morosely as she
drove her car along Hamilton Pike to keep her
engagement with Doris that not a single thing she
had planned since first she had come to Hamilton
College as a student had ever turned out advantageously
to her. She did not in the least blame herself
or her methods. She was conceitedly sure of herself.
Someone or something had always “butted
in” at the wrong time. Or else the persons on whom
she depended to do their parts in her various schemes
had failed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>She wondered if her father had received the letter
she had written him. She was confident that
it would be forwarded to him if he were not in New
York. She was particularly anxious to know where
he was. She hoped he was not in New York. For
weeks, a scheme, the most ambitious plan to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>trouble which Leslie had yet concocted, had been
foremost in her thoughts. It had kept her busy ever
since Thanksgiving, daily visiting her garage property
and prowling in the immediate neighborhood
of the dormitory building. The gray stone walls
of the dormitory were well started and steadily
reaching upward, a fact which seemed to furnish
Leslie with deep though frowning interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coming within sight of the dormitory that afternoon
she had glanced toward it and given a short
angry laugh. She had then stopped her car for a
moment to compare the activities on the dormitory
lot with those going on at her garage site. The
operation of tearing down the old houses in the
block she had purchased, and afterward clearing the
ground, had gone very slowly. The contractor who
had charge of that part of the work had dragged it,
so as to benefit himself. Under honest management
the operation should have been far enough advanced
at least to show the garage cellar dug. As it was the
ground she owned was yet partially littered with the
debris of demolishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>When she had finally arrived at the Colonial there
to find Doris waiting for her at one of the tables
she had reached a point where nothing could please
her. On the way from the dormitory site to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Colonial she had decided to go to New York alone
over the holidays. She had important work to do.
She did not propose to allow entertaining Doris to
interfere with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her first words to Doris on seating herself at the
table had been: “The trip to New York is off,
Goldie. I can’t take you with me, I mean. I have
to go, but entirely on business, I must go alone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her disappointment very keen on hearing such
depressing news, Doris had received Leslie’s announcement
with bad grace. More, she had accused
Leslie of not being a person of her word. The two
girls had argued and squabbled as was their wont.
Doris was particularly incensed over the fact that
she had refused two invitations from adoring
freshmen to go home with them for the holidays.
Three different sophs had also extended her invitations.
She had refused them all because she most
fancied the New York trip. Now Leslie had changed
her mind and she, Doris Monroe, would be the only
loser.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie had relied on her most sarcastic, overbearing
manner to cope with Doris’s indignant explosion.
As before, when they had stood out against each
other, Leslie found her match. Doris proved herself
so utterly, scornfully thorny that Leslie finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>backed water and volunteered the sulky promise
that if she possibly could she would take Doris to
New York as she had first agreed. Doris herself
had not asked it. Neither had she appeared to take
note of the promise. When she left Leslie at the
door of the Colonial, refusing to enter her car, she
had merely said “good-bye” in the iciest of tones.
This did not worry Leslie. It was not the first time
Doris had walked away miffed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doris, however, was not only angry at Leslie for
her wilful unreliability, she was experiencing a
healthy contempt for Leslie herself. She contrasted
Leslie’s standards and ideals with those of the
girls on the campus whom she was beginning to
know, understand and like. She liked the jolly,
worshipping freshmen who had made so much of
her. They were an honorable set. She liked Louise
Walker, Calista Wilmot and Charlotte Robbins particularly
among the sophs. She admired Gussie
Forbes, though she never went near her. She knew
Gussie to be devoted to Marjorie Dean. She had
quite a secret crush on Robin Page, though she would
have died rather than admit it. She liked Phyllis
Moore and Barbara Severn. She also liked Muriel
and admired her for her sturdy principles. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>kept these likes to herself, however, pretending to
be more indifferent than she was.</p>

<p class='c006'>She could not be among such girls long without
discerning the difference between their ethical
standards and those of Leslie Cairns. She detested
Leslie’s unscrupulousness, yet there were times when
she admired the ex-student’s sang froid. She saw
the really humorous, clever side of Leslie and felt
vaguely sorry for her because she was so unprepossessing.
She realized Leslie’s power through money,
but she had lost her respect for the lawless girl on
that head.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had hurried into the early winter twilight from
the tea room feeling as though she never wished
to see Leslie Cairns again. All the way from the
campus gates to Wayland Hall she continued to think
darkly of what she had lost by Leslie’s selfish tactics.
She had announced so confidently, in refusing
other Christmas invitations, that she expected to
spend the holidays in New York. Now she would
not humble her pride by letting it be known that she
had been disappointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>In consequence Muriel’s invitation, delivered immediately
after she reached her room, came as a
consoling surprise. Instantly followed remembrance
that Muriel was one of the Sanford five whom Leslie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>detested. She recalled her own antagonism
toward Marjorie Dean. To accept a Christmas invitation
to Muriel’s home meant the acceptance of
Muriel’s chums as friendly acquaintances. It flashed
upon Doris in that moment of self-examination that
there was no reason why she should not accept as
her friends the four Sanford girls who were Muriel
Harding’s intimates.</p>

<p class='c006'>Following that illuminating flash came a thought
far from noble. It took strong hold of Doris. How
piqued Leslie Cairns would be were she to accept
Muriel’s invitation. It would serve Leslie right. It
would show her that she, Doris Monroe, had the
courage of independence. She had no faith in Leslie’s
final grudging assurance that the trip to New
York should be made as they had planned it. Leslie
had changed her mind once, she was likely to disappoint
her again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thought of Leslie and a resentful desire to exasperate
her completely outweighed consideration of
the purely social side of Muriel’s invitation. Doris’s
momentary hesitation after Muriel had invited her
did not arise, as Muriel had surmised, from regretful
embarrassment at her lack of cordiality toward
Muriel’s chums. Doris’s mind was fully occupied
with one idea—the beneficial effect her trip to Sanford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>would have upon Leslie. She would write Leslie
a note informing her of the astonishing change
in her Christmas plans. If Leslie chose to rage
over the matter, she must rage it out alone. Doris
resolved that she would not see Leslie again until
after she had returned to the campus from the
trip to Sanford.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris’s thoughts were so entirely centered on
the disagreeable effect her decision would have upon
Leslie Cairns she did not stop to consider what
her freshie and sophomore admirers might think of
her change of plans. She decided to wait two days
before writing to Leslie. She had been rather shaky
in mathematics for a week past and needed to devote
herself assiduously to it until she was beyond
a stage that courted being conditioned. She had
sweetly assured Muriel that she would not change
her mind at the last minute.</p>

<p class='c006'>She put off the writing of the note to Leslie until
she had finished her self-appointed review in mathematics.
She wished to have a free mind in which
to write Leslie. Her note should be a triumph of
cleverness. On this point she was determined.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime Muriel had circulated the news
that Doris was to be her Christmas guest, with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>innocently smiling face. Clever Muriel did not propose
to give her sophomore catch an opportunity
to wriggle out of her agreement at the last minute.
“It’s just as well to publish the Ice Queen’s thaw
from the housetops,” she gaily confided to Jerry and
Marjorie. “The amazing fact that the Ice Queen
and I are chummy will have a soothing, beneficial
effect upon such revolutionists as the Phonograph,
the Prime Minister, and such.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is some truth in your disrespectful remarks
about these erring sophie sisters,” Jerry had
reluctantly agreed. “We can only trust, Matchless
Muriel, that you may always get away with your
reckless use of pet names. I believe I’ve mentioned
this hope before.”</p>

<p class='c006'>While Doris, having coolly mapped out her own
course, was as coolly pursuing her own way, Leslie
was impatiently waiting to hear from her. She believed
that Doris was too greatly bent on going with
her to New York to remain miffed. Doris would
soon write or call her on the telephone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Instead of two days it took Doris three to complete
her mathematical review. During that time
she kept a “Busy” sign in frequent display upon the
door, a proceeding which Muriel had advised her to
do. Since her acceptance of Muriel’s invitation the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>two girls had become far more friendly than before.
Both felt the relief attending the change and
welcomed the pleasant interest it permitted them to
exhibit in each other’s campus affairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the fourth afternoon following her quarrel
with Leslie Cairns, Doris hurried to her room from
her trigonometry period, bent in writing the letter
to Leslie. It lacked only three days of the closing
of Hamilton College for the holidays. It was high
time she wrote it, she reflected. During the next
three busy days there would be little opportunity.
She sighed audible satisfaction as she entered the
room to find it deserted. She hoped Muriel would
remain away until dinner time. Prudently she
brought out the busy sign from its place in the
table drawer and affixed it with a brass tack to
an outside panel of the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having finally settled herself at the study table to
write she spent several minutes in thoughtful deliberation
before she wrote:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Leslie</span>:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know, of course, in what an annoying position
you placed me by disappointing me about our
New York vacation. I had been invited by a number
of other girls, some of them upper class, to spend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Christmas at their homes. I refused the invitations—saying
that I had already been invited by a dear
friend to spend the holidays in New York. Naturally,
after you had failed me, I could hardly have
the bad taste to go to any one of these friends, stating
that I had changed my mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Since you disappointed me, Miss Harding, my
roommate has invited me to spend Christmas with
her at her Sanford home. I have accepted. Although
you said, just before I left you the other
day at the Colonial, that you had re-considered, and
would try to arrange the New York trip, I was not
impressed. I doubted your intention to keep your
word. You have a habit—”</p>

<p class='c006'>A forceful fist applied to the door, regardless of
the “Busy” sign, brought Doris to her feet with
a displeased “Oh!” She stood for a brief moment,
hesitating, before she made any movement toward
the door. While the sign was warranted to keep
away other students, it was not prohibitive to Miss
Remson, the maids or the laundress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” she exclaimed again as her eyes took in
the tall, severe figure of Julia Peyton.</p>

<p class='c006'>The yellow-white of the sophomore’s complexion
turned to dull red under the bored scrutiny of Doris’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>sea-green eyes. “I saw your sign.” She rolled her
black eyes toward it. “I simply had to disregard it.
I knew you were alone. It was too good a chance
to miss. I really had to see you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why?” was Doris’s close-clipped question. She
had not yet invited the other girl into the room. She
knew she was rude, but she did not care. She did
not like Julia Peyton, although Julia was one of her
most annoyingly devoted admirers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, for a very important reason. To prove to
you that I am a true friend, Doris,” Julia wagged
her black head in time to her last four emphatic
words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t in the least understand you,” Doris returned
stiffly. “Come in. I am really awfully busy.
I have an important letter to—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I won’t stay long,” Julia assured, entering with
an alacrity which indicated the importance of her
own mission. Without waiting to be invited she
sat down in a wicker chair and burst forth: “You’re
not really going home for Christmas with Miss
Harding, are you? I was told so yesterday, but
I didn’t believe it. I heard the same silly report
today. It worried me. I simply had to come to
you with it.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Why should such a report worry you?” Doris
demanded half in disdain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I’d hate to see you put yourself in a
position where you might be ridiculed.” Julia eyed
Doris with mysterious pity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ridiculed?” Doris’s greenish eyes widened in
instant offense. Her exclamation was one of
haughty unbelief. “Do say what you are trying to
say, directly,” she commanded. “I have yet to place
myself open to ridicule.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just what I told Clara,” cried Julia. “I
was sure you wouldn’t go home for Christmas with
that horrid Miss Harding.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I <i>am</i> going home with her,” Doris returned
with elaborate unconcern. A tantalizing impulse to
nettle Julia seized her. “She is not horrid. She is
clever, and rather good fun.” Doris drew the chair,
in which she had been sitting when Julia knocked,
away from the table. She sat down and cast a measuring
glance at her tiresome caller.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You won’t think so after you know why she has
invited you to her home.” The sophomore’s black
brows drew together. Her round black eyes assumed
their most “moony” appearance. “She invited you
because she couldn’t find anybody else at Hamilton
to invite. I have found out positively that she has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>invited four different off-campus girls <i>and everyone
of them has turned her down</i>.” Julia’s voice rose
in shrill triumph. “What do you think of that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Without waiting to hear Doris’s opinion she rattled
on maliciously. “Miss Dean and that crowd
Miss Harding is chummy with have been pretending
to be the ones who have invited those off-campus
beggars to their homes for the holidays. I know
for a fact that none of them have done much in that
direction. Miss Dean, who’s supposed to be such a
sweet little model of goodness and generosity, is going
to entertain at home—not the off-campus frumps.
Oh, no! She is going to take Miss Harper, Miss
Mason, Miss Page home with her. Miss Macy will
lug home that tall, blue-eyed, lazy-looking girl that’s
visiting Miss Remson. Miss Lynne has invited Miss
Moore and Miss Severn. Even grouchy Miss
Warner is going to entertain Langly. That’s the
way they benefit their precious ‘dormitory girls’
that they are always crowing about.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fail to see how all this applies to me.” Doris
showed plain signs of becoming frosty. She was only
half interested in Julia’s lengthy, spiteful argument.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m only trying to show you how selfish and what
fakes that crowd of priggies are. Just the same what
I said about Miss Harding having invited you because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>she couldn’t get anyone else applies to you,”
was Julia’s dogged assertion. “I heard she felt sorry
for you because you—well, had no home influences—er—that
you came clear from England alone and—that—and—”
Julia floundered desperately, then
paused.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What does Miss Harding know of me? Nothing.”
Doris sprang to her feet in a swift blaze of
wrath. “Who told you she said such things of me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Julia solemnly shook her head. As a matter of
truth she was merely repeating several of her roommate’s,
Clara Carter’s, vague suppositions. “I can’t
tell you that. She—er—I only heard she felt that
way about you. You see, Doris, I asked you to
go home with me for the holidays, but you said you
were going to New York,” she reminded in reproachful
tones. “I supposed you would go with Miss
Cairns. All of a sudden you turned around and accepted
Miss Harding’s invitation. I thought it rather
unfair in you, when I had asked you first of all.
I thought you might at least have come to me and
said—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will not be lectured by anyone!” Doris cried
out angrily. “I don’t care what you thought. I
could explain to you precisely why I accepted an invitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>from Miss Harding to spend Christmas
with her at her home, but I shall not do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shouldn’t call a friendly confidence, such as I’ve
just given you, a lecture. I’m sure I haven’t asked
you to explain anything. I think I’d better go now.
I’ve done my duty as your friend, even if you can’t
understand that now. You will sometime soon, I
hope.” Julia rose, stalked to the door; a picture of
offended dignity. “You’ll be sorry if you go home
with Miss Harding.” She could not resist this last
fling. “You’ll lose caste on the campus. Remember,
she has invited you as a last choice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am <i>not</i> going home with Miss Harding.”
Doris brought one slippered foot down with an
angry stamp. “I suppose I ought to thank you for
telling me what you have. I don’t feel like thanking
anyone for anything. I shall go to New York for
Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“With Miss Cairns?” eagerly quizzed Julia.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, with Miss Cairns,” Doris answered; then
added bitterly: “She has invited me to go there
with her because we are friends; not because she
feels sorry for me.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>DEFEATING HER OWN HAPPINESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When the door had closed on her gossiping
caller Doris sat down again at the table. She leaned
her beautiful head on her white, dimpled arms and
gave herself up to brief disconsolate reverie. Now
that she was alone she wondered whether what Julia
Peyton had said about Muriel Harding was strictly
true. There was one way in which she could find
out with certainty. She would ask Muriel point-blank
if it were true that four off-campus girls had
refused her invitation. She would ask Muriel, also,
where she had gained so much information regarding
herself. When she endeavored to recall Julia’s exact
words she found they did not mean much. Julia’s
reluctant inflections, her stammering pauses, had implied
so much more than words.</p>

<p class='c006'>Julia’s object in warning Doris against Muriel had
been double. Since the evening when she had made
complaint against the noise in Room 15 she had
shown marked hostility to the knot of post graduates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>at Wayland Hall. She and Clara Carter had
encouraged Doris in her half fancied dislike for
them. She had noted the new spirit of friendliness
growing between Doris and Muriel with every
intention of crushing it if she could. She kept up
a zealous watching and longing for an opportunity
to create dissention between them. She had a
habit of dropping in on Doris in her room when
Muriel was there purposely to see how things were
between the two. She never spoke to Muriel, however.</p>

<p class='c006'>About the time she had begun to despair of making
mischief between them she was delighted to
overhear a group of chattering freshmen in the
gymnasium one afternoon gaily discussing their
Christmas plans. What most pleased her were the
remarks of one of them: “Isn’t it too bad? Miss
Harding can’t find a single dorm to trot home with
her. They are all attached. It’s too bad for her.
I mean. Of course it’s lovely for the dorms.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The jealous, prejudiced girl had chosen to place
an entirely different construction upon the remarks
from that intended by the merry little freshman. By
the time she had repeated the remarks to Clara
Carter, her roommate, with embellishments, they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>assumed an ugly tone. Clara also contributed a
few opinions which did not improve matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>Added to this it needed but the rumor that Doris
Monroe was going home with Miss Harding for
the holidays to set the mischief-making pair of
sophomores to work. Julia was of the opinion that
since Doris had planned to go home with Muriel
she and Miss Cairns must have quarreled. If she
could only set Doris against her roommate then
Doris would go home for the vacation with her.
She would have the pleasure of boasting that she
had entertained the college beauty. She was confident
that she would gain socially by having entertained
Doris as her guest. With so much to be
gained to her interest Julia had picked her hour and
boldly braved the “Busy” sign and Doris’s “royal”
manner. At the last she had not dared propose to
Doris that her wrathful classmate should spend the
vacation with her. She returned to her room to
inform Clara, who was watching for her, that she
had just missed getting into an awful mess.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a pettish little jerk of her head Doris
straightened in her chair. She picked up the letter
she had been writing from the table and began reading
it over. Then she sat staring reflectively at
it, as though deliberating some very special course.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Next instant and she had torn the unfinished letter
in pieces. With the peculiar cresting of her golden
head, always a sign of defiance, she reached for her
fountain pen where it had rolled to one end of the
table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear Leslie:” she wrote, her green eyes darkening
with her unquiet thoughts. “If you really meant
what you said when I left you the other day at the
Colonial, then I will take you at your word. Miss
Harding, my roommate, has invited me to go home
with her. I prefer to go to New York with you,
provided you will not feel that I am an incumbrance
to your plans. Let me know immediately
what you wish to do.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>“<span class='sc'>Doris Monroe</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>She read the brief note, folded it and prepared
it for mailing. Then she tucked the envelope in
her portfolio, but without a stamp. She glanced
up at the clock. It was nearing six. Muriel would
soon arrive. Of late she and Muriel had exchanged
the cheerful, careless greetings of girlhood when they
met in their room or on the campus. She had lately
begun to find a roommate might be a congenial comfort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>instead of a tiresome inconvenience. Now
it was all spoiled. Muriel had pretended pity for
her to other students. Of all things detested, Doris
most disliked being pitied.</p>

<p class='c006'>In spite of her anger against Muriel, Doris could
do no less than admit to herself that Julia Peyton’s
word was not to be taken above Muriel’s. Yet she
was sullenly convinced that Muriel must have said
something pitying about her to someone. How
else could Julia have heard it? A bright flush dyed
her face as she thought of herself as being a last-resort
guest. Perhaps Muriel had been asked by
Miss Dean to invite her, merely as a welfare experiment.
She had heard that Miss Dean was fond
of making such experiments. It was outrageous
that <i>she</i> should have been selected as the victim of
one. Other far-fetched, flashing conjectures visited
her troubled brain as she waited for Muriel’s coming.
She could not decide whether to treat Muriel
with friendliness, asking her frankly for an explanation,
or to resort once again to her old-time haughty
indifference.</p>

<p class='c006'>Muriel’s sudden breezy entrance and accompanying
cry: “Where, oh, where, are the lickerish lights?”
took Doris’s mind off herself for a moment. Muriel
had already pressed the switch near the door. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>made such an attractive study in her gray squirrel
coat and cap, cheeks carnation pink, dark eyes snapping
with sheer love of life Doris had no desire
to be haughty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I forgot the lights,” she said with a little shrug.
She continued to watch Muriel who was removing
coat and cap. “I should like to ask you something,”
she said as Muriel hung up her wraps and commenced
smoothing her ruffled hair before a mirror.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ask ahead.” Muriel waved affable permission
with her hair brush.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is there—are there—am I the only guest you
have invited for Christmas?” Unconsciously Doris’s
voice had taken on a shade of its former icy quality.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re the only one who’s coming,” laughed
Muriel. “You’re by no means the only one I invited.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” Doris gave a queer little gasp.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you hear about my dormitory girls? I invited
them, and they accepted. Then they had unexpected
checks sent them from home and away they
went. I wandered around looking for some checkless,
invitationless dorms. There were no such stoojents.”
Muriel declared good-humoredly. “I supposed of
course you were dated ahead for the holidays. Then
I asked you, and found you weren’t. I was so glad.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>I’d have felt sorry to think of you poking around
the campus over Christmas alone. You’re so far
from home, you see. Marjorie said the same and—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t wish anyone to be sorry for me.” Doris’s
almost fierce utterance checked Muriel’s flow of
cheery volubility.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right. I’m not sorry a bit. You only
dreamed I was,” she retorted in a tone of gay raillery.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m not jesting. I am serious.” Doris drew herself
up, a slim figure of affronted dignity. All that
Julia had said of Muriel was true. Only one question,
and Muriel had then practically admitted saying
almost the exact words Julia had quoted as hers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh-h-h?” Muriel voiced the monosyllable questioningly.
Her bright expression faded into concern.
“Serious about what?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“About not wishing you or Miss Dean or any of
your friends to be sorry for me. I have plenty of
friends—delightful friends. Why, I’ve refused half
a dozen Christmas invitations! I have changed my
mind about going home with you. I’m not going.
I shall go to New York instead. I might have liked
you, if you hadn’t tried to pity me behind my back.
That was worse than to my face. Please tell Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Dean to mind her own affairs. I am not a welfare
experiment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doris delivered the long answer to Muriel’s question
in a voice that grew more scornful with each
word. She busied herself as she sputtered forth her
displeasure with the donning of hat and coat. With
“experiment” she snatched the letter she had written
to Leslie Cairns from the portfolio, hastily affixed
a stamp to the envelope and rushed from the
room. Muriel watched her go, divided between
vexation and perplexity. What under the sun had
happened to the Ice Queen?</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>“You know, if you are good, Santa Claus will
surely visit you on Christmas eve,” Marjorie was
gravely saying to the bright-faced, alert little old
lady ensconced in a big cushiony chair before the
cheerful open fireplace. Marjorie emphasized her
injunction with gentle little shakes of a forefinger.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How good do I have to be? Will Santa Claus
come down the chimney?” anxiously questioned Miss
Susanna in a high treble that evoked a burst of
merriment from the rest of the little group gathered
about the fire. “Miss Susanna’s bodyguard,” Vera
had lightly named Leila, Robin, Marjorie and herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How good do you think you can be?” Marjorie
paused to allow her question to take effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That will depend upon the reward of goodness,”
chuckled the old lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are altogether too precautious.” Marjorie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>simulated disapproval. “But you can’t fool Santa.
He will know the minute he sees you just what sort
of little girl you are.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna peeped through her fingers at Marjorie
in a funny, abashed, child-like fashion that
elicited fresh laughter. “You can’t fool me, either.
He never <i>could</i> come down the chimney and out of
that fireplace. I’m going to tell him what you said,
when I see him. Then maybe he won’t like you,”
she predicted in juvenile triumph.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I didn’t say he’d come down <i>our</i> chimney,”
reprovingly corrected Marjorie. “I only said he
<i>might</i> visit you. He always <i>used</i> to come in at that
window over there.” She pointed to one of the living
room east windows which opened upon a side
veranda.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna appeared impressed at last. “Yes;
he could get in here that way. I guess I’d better
be good.” A little shout greeted her reluctant admission.
“Such a day as I’ve had, children.” She
gave a sigh of perfect happiness. “I’m certainly
beginning to make up for some of the customs and
rites of old Christmas I have missed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The jolly Christmas company from Hamilton
College had arrived in Sanford in the evening of
the previous day. They had separated briefly at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>station to go to their various destinations blithely
promising Marjorie to be on hand by ten o’clock
the next morning to go to a neighboring woods on
a winter picnic. The express object of the picnic
was the securing and bringing home of the Christmas
tree to Castle Dean.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hard labor part of the expedition had fallen
to General Dean. He had complained of the detail
in a loud, ungeneral-like manner as a “one-man,
wood-chopping stunt,” and had immediately engaged
the services of Hal Macy, Charlie Stevens and Danny
Seabrooke. The wages they demanded were: “Lots
of good eats, and a chance to hang around with
the crowd.” The wily general affably agreed to
their demand without consulting either the commissary
or entertainment departments.</p>

<p class='c006'>It had proved a memorably merry day. The fun
began when the rollicking, cheering forest expedition
had piled onto the two long bob sleds, each
drawn by four big, satin-coated field horses. It had
continued until the young foresters had come singing
home through the dusk, the sleds laden with
fragrant balsam trees and boughs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bred to thrive in the great outdoors the sturdy
mistress of Hamilton Arms had enjoyed the winter
picnic no less than her youthful companions. While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>there had been sufficient snow to permit the use
of the bob sleds, it was of the frost-like crystallized
kind. The sun had peered curiously forth from
his winter quarters, had apparently approved the
gay winter cavalcade. He had flashed in and out
of fleecy clouds at them on their way to the woods.
Later, when they had hilariously disposed themselves
on the bob sleds for an al fresco luncheon
he had come out in all his glory to shine on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>What most amused the girls was the crush which
Miss Susanna and Hal immediately developed for
each other. Miss Hamilton and Hal had met at
the June Commencement of Hamilton College of
the previous summer. Devotion to Marjorie had
formed an instant, though unspoken bond between
them. Hal had somehow gained the comforting impression
that Miss Susanna approved of him for
Marjorie. The shrewd old lady had not miscalculated
his worth. She had been too wise, however
even to mention him to Marjorie. Nor had
Marjorie ever mentioned Hal to her save as an
old friend, or as Jerry’s brother.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wise old Lady of the Arms had seen too much
of heartache, misunderstanding and vain regret not
to appreciate the wonder of the love which Hal held
for Marjorie. Miss Susanna had had her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>romance. It had ended summarily in her girlhood
when she found the man she had loved unworthy.
In true love itself she still believed, though she
skeptically rated it as so rare as to be almost extinct.
Then had come Hal, with his clean-cut good
looks and wistful blue eyes. She could only receive
him into her interested regard with the hope Marjorie
might one day “wake up to love.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Friends of Marjorie Dean knew the quartette of
stories relative to her doings at Sanford High
School. They form the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean High
School Series</span>.” These friends have also followed
her through her four years at Hamilton College
by medium of the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean College
Series</span>.” Her subsequent return to Hamilton
campus as a post graduate has been set down in the
first two volumes of the “<span class='sc'>Post Graduate Series</span>,”
entitled respectively: “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean, College
Post Graduate</span>,” and “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean, Marvelous
Manager</span>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has been a good day; now let it be—good
night,” declaimed Leila with a dramatic gesture.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good night,” Vera sweetly responded. “So sorry
you are going.” She smiled honeyed dismissal of
Leila.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“But I am not going. Now why should you think
I was? I see little sadness in your round face, Midget,”
was the satiric retort.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You said ‘good night.’ Of course, if you didn’t
know what you were saying—” Vera shrugged
eloquently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can you not allow your Celtic friend to quote
from that most celebrated of all playwrights, Leila
Harper?” demanded Leila, with an air of deep injury.
“Is not that the hero’s parting speech from
my latest and best house play? I can prove it by
Robin. Did I not nearly ruin my fine Irish voice
drilling the hero to say it with expression?”</p>

<p class='c006'>In process of delivering this scathing rebuke to
Midget Leila bent down and swept Ruffle, Marjorie’s
stately Angora cat, into her arms. “It is you
and I who will now have a talk about Santa Claus,”
she genially informed the struggling, fluffy-haired
captive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“N-n-u-u-u!” objected Ruffle in a deep displeased
tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So you can say ‘no.’ Well, it is ‘yes’ you should
say. Let me tell you it is not about Santa Claus,
but about Ruffle Claws we should be talking. You
have a fine sharp assortment.” Ruffle had threateningly
spread his claws but had refrained from using
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>them. “You are more gentle than I should be
if some tall, wide person had the boldness to swing
me up off my feet.” Leila willingly released the big,
handsome gray and white puss.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruffle immediately sidled over to Miss Susanna,
waving his plumy tail. He began a slow walk around
her chair, keeping his luminous gray-green eyes
fastened persistently upon her. Presently deciding
that his mute plea was in vain he hopped up into her
lap and settled himself upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here comes General. Look out, Miss Susanna.
He is more dangerous than Ruffle. He would as
soon tip you out of that chair as not.” Marjorie
sent out this timely warning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I heard you.” Mr. Dean had stepped
briefly into the living room on his way to the street.
“I can’t stop to assert myself. Tomorrow I’ll spend
a Merry Christmas dumping usurpers out of my
chair. Anyone found sitting in it will be eligible to
dumping. All persons thus dumped must pick themselves
up without the slightest assistance from me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your hear that, Ruffle?” Robin Page laughingly
reached forward and gently tweaked one of Ruffle’s
white whiskers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tomorrow never comes,” Marjorie said teasingly.
“But, here’s an unofficial order for you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>General Dean;” she pointed a forceful finger at her
father. “Pick up your detachment as soon as you
can and hike for—you know where,” she added with
mischievous lights dancing in her brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Lieutenant,” Mr. Dean saluted. “Never
give your superior officer orders. Under the circumstances,
however, I will overlook your lack of
proper military respect.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, General.” Marjorie saluted with
a great show of respect. Her parting injunction to
her superior officer, delivered in the next breath was
deplorably lacking in that particular military requisite.
“You’d better overlook it and obey my order,”
she called after him as he left the room, laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something is going on here besides a possible visit
from Saint Nick,” asserted Vera positively. “The
air of mystery in this barrack has been growing ever
since dinner. Why did Captain disappear so suddenly,
right after dinner, without a word to anyone?
And Delia went with her. They slid out the
front door in such a rush!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s Christmas Eve, you know.” Marjorie made
this trite explanation with great cheerfulness. “All
sorts of remarkable things are likely to happen on
Christmas Eve.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then the rest of the crowd must have been lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>in this mysterious atmosphere,” commented Leila
with naive conviction. “It is eight o’clock, and not
one of them here. I have my suspicions of you,
Beauty. You are too full of mystery to be reliable.
Who knows what dark Christmas contraption you
have framed for the poor Lady of the Arms and
three more of us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who knows but I?” Marjorie tantalized. “Oh,
well; it wasn’t so very long ago that I walked into
a campus contraption all of you had set for me.
Please don’t forget to remember that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The prolonged peal of the door bell sent her running
on light feet to the door. A sound of soft
voices and smothered giggles in the hall, then she
and Muriel Harding entered the living room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it you know that you think so funny?”
Leila began on Muriel. “I always supposed I knew
more than you. It seems I do not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you don’t,” Muriel was quick to assure.
“You now see what conceited delusions you’ve
cherished. For further delusions consult the stars.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should be ashamed to consult them about such
foolishness.” Leila’s smiling urbanity matched
Muriel’s own bland assurance. “They might choose
to rate me as a dummy.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Both doors into the drawing room are locked.”
Robin Page now added to the case against Lieutenant
Dean. “I was going to charm you with an after-dinner
Christmas carol and, bing! Robin was locked
out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Muriel and Marjorie treated Robin’s plaintive
announcement as a huge joke. They locked arms, sat
down on the davenport exactly together with a frisky
jounce and shed beaming effulgence on their companions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There has been a villain’s convention somewhere,”
growled Leila in the deep rumble she called her
“Celtic double-bass.” “Speak, Lady of the Arms.
Name the arch villain.” She made a sudden melodramatic
lunge toward Miss Susanna, who had been
following the exchange of exuberant raillery in
enjoying silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sh-h-h-h.” Miss Susanna raised a small, cautioning
hand. “I’m trying to be good. Don’t break
the spell.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Simultaneous with her warning came a new sound.
It proceeded from the very window Marjorie had
pointed out to Miss Susanna as a possible entrance
for Santa Claus. The window was slowly rising,
shoved upward by a pair of energetic arms. Came
a flash of shiny black, cherry red and snowy white.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Into the room bounced Santa Claus, resplendent in
high black boots and long-coated scarlet suit. His
rosy face was framed in the venerable whiteness of
luxurious cotton locks. His flaming costume was
also lavishly trimmed with the same useful cotton.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good evening, all,” he piped in a high, cheerful
voice. “I have come to find a little girl named
Susie Hamilton. I am going to take her and her
little playmates to the North Pole with me to spend
Christmas Eve.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OFF TO THE NORTH POLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The amazed hush that followed Santa Claus’s
hospitable declaration was lifted by a gleeful chuckle
from Miss Susanna. With the appearance into the
room of the fabled Kris Kringle she had hastily set
Ruffle from her lap to the floor and risen to her feet.
Ruffle placidly took advantage of the situation to
gain the coveted chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leila and Vera were hardly less diverted over the
sight of Santa Claus than was the last of the Hamiltons.
Neither of them knew home as Marjorie,
Robin, Muriel and their intimates knew its fond
meaning. Leila’s Celtic love of the mystic, fanciful
and fictional, had been shared by Vera during
their years of comradeship at Hamilton College.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m that little girl. I’m Susie Hamilton.” Miss
Susanna walked slowly toward Santa Claus with
a droll assumption of shyness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t say so? How are you, Susie?”
Santa gave the supposed little girl a gripping handshake.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“I heard you had been very good. I hope
these other little girls have.” He turned very blue,
very suspicious eyes upon Muriel, who merely
beamed at him familiarly and inquired: “Where’s
your friend?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see trouble ahead for one of these infants,”
remarked a voice from Santa’s beard that sounded
strangely like that of Jerry Macy. Immediately recovering
his high-pitched voice Santa announced:
“My friend, the King of the North Pole is outside.
As my reindeer are all very busy tonight he is going
to give me a lift.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The King of the North Pole evidently yearned for
an introduction. A head covered with a peaked,
close-fitting hood of glistening, glittering white, followed
by a pair of broad shoulders, draped in the
same glittering, frost-like material, appeared in the
window frame. The reigning monarch of the North
Pole, after a brief struggle in passage with a voluminous
white cape, landed triumphantly among the admiring
company.</p>

<p class='c006'>A conspicuous bulge in the right side of his glittering
cape disappeared as he drew forth a fluffy
white worsted coat and held it open for Miss Susanna
to slip on. Next moment he had picked her up, carried
her across the room, swung her through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>window and to her feet on the porch floor. Gathering
his cape closely about him, he launched through
the open frame after her. Again he caught her
up, laughing and unresisting, and ran down the walk
with her to where a little, old-fashioned cutter,
painted bright red and with furry white lap robes
awaited her. A large, mild-eyed white horse was
harnessed to the cutter, his harness gay with scarlet
ribbon rosettes. The King lifted Miss Susanna
into the cutter, tucked the furs about her then stood
looking laughingly down at her. Nor would he
utter a sound. He merely waved a re-assuring hand
toward Santa Claus, who had dashed out the front
door and was now running down the walk at a kind
of wild gallop.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re next,” Santa shrieked over a plump
shoulder at the knot of pursuing girls. Reaching
the sleigh the juvenile patron saint made a lively
leap into it beside Miss Susanna, gathered up the
reins, clucked to the horse and whirled away with
the Lady of the Arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No time like the present.” The King of the
North Pole found his voice. “Either get into my
chariot, or be bundled in,” he threatened with smiles.
The chariot had been parked behind the sleigh. It
greatly resembled Jerry’s limousine.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“I’m not ready to go to the North Pole, your
Majesty,” blithely petitioned Marjorie. “I haven’t
yet locked up my castle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Delia was at the back door when I came in the
window. Want to be bundled in?” The King sent
significant glances from the car to Marjorie and
back again. He had already gallantly assisted the
other girls into the limousine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, indeed.” Marjorie followed her companions
into the back of the machine. There they found a
collection of Jerry’s wraps placed to meet the
emergency. Marjorie smiled to herself as she
draped a wide fleecy scarf over her silk-clad shoulders.
As the King of the North Pole, Hal had the old,
teasing school-boy manner she liked best in him. She
hoped he would keep to it throughout her stay in
Sanford.</p>

<p class='c006'>It presently developed that the King of the North
Pole had decided to move his icy domain over Christmas
to the Macy’s ball room. There it was that
Santa also had his headquarters. Miss Susanna was
whisked to the top of the Macy’s big house in an
elevator and escorted into the ball room, now festally
decorated from end to end with fragrant balsam
boughs, long trails of sturdy green ground pine and
glossy-leaved flaming-berried holly. From the central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>electric chandelier depended a bunch of pearly
mistletoe berries.</p>

<p class='c006'>Santa Claus’s eight reindeer had reached home
ahead of their master. Jerry’s four “dorms,”
Ronny’s two, Lucy and Kathie, had chosen this
detail. Their costumes had been planned for them
by Jerry and carried out by Mrs. Dean and Mrs.
Macy several days before the arrival at Sanford of
the celebrated reindeer themselves. Their brown cotton
flannel suits of bloomers and close-fitting knee
coats, together with brown hose and sneakers were
quite realistic when topped by brown cotton flannel
antlered hoods. The antlers were triumphs of
pasteboard ingenuity. Their only drawback was
their tendency to wabble at times, thereby giving their
wearers an appearance of recklessness not attributed
to the famous Santa Claus eight. Harnesses strung
with little bells completed their costumes.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the far end of the room in one corner stood an
immense Christmas tree, resplendent with its glitter
of gilt, silver and gorgeous-hued ornaments. At
the foot of the tree was stacked a wealth of festively
wrapped, ribbon-bound bundles. The eight reindeer
escorted Santa Claus and Miss Susanna gaily up
the hall to where a deep, garnet velvet Sleepy Hollow
chair stood awaiting an occupant. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>hardly been established in it when the King of the
North Pole and his party arrived.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My reindeer will entertain you with a song and
dance,” Santa Claus piped up, when the first buzz
of voices and echoing laughter had died out in the
big room. “After that my fiddler will furnish music
and we will all have a dance. I will lead with my
little friend, Susie. Please don’t all try to dance at
once with the King of the North Pole.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No one except Jeremiah Macy would offer such
simple advice,” Muriel pleasantly told the king himself.
“Too bad you have no gentleman friends besides
Santa Claus.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, but I have,” was the king’s cheering disclosure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really?” Muriel showed deep interest. “Where
do you keep them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s a secret.” The king put on an aggravatingly
wise expression. “There are lots of good
hiding places at the North Pole.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as I thought!” Muriel exclaimed in triumph.
“I knew you and Jeremiah couldn’t stay away from
home all day at the picnic and do this decorating
between dinner time and eight o’clock. You had
help—h-e-l-p!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly I had,” the king admitted. “General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and Captain were here and helped the Governor and
Mother trim the tree. So did Delia. But they’ve
gone home now to trim Marjorie’s tree.” He regarded
Muriel with an innocent candor which the
sparkle in his eyes contradicted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can’t fool me, Mister King of the North
Pole Macy,” she said as the eight reindeer trotted
out upon the waxed floor to do their bit toward entertaining.
Before they had time to begin their
song Muriel’s fingers flashed to her lips. Twice she
sounded the sharp clear whistle which she and Jerry
had long ago made Hal teach them how to blow
on the fingers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now you have done it!” The king laughed
nevertheless as the ball room door swung open and a
troop of joyfully grinning young men filed in, led
by Danny Seabrooke. “Who told you the signal?”
he demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I knew if Danny Seabrooke was within hearing
of it, he’d come at that whistle. And he did,”
laughed Muriel. “You had Danny and his crowd
tucked away in the garret next to the ball room.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You should have seen them work after we brought
the decorations up here from the wagon. We had
only about an hour and a half for the job and I
had to leave before it was finished and go with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Jerry—Santa Claus, I should say.” Hal exhibited
boyish pride in the success of the decorating. “I’d
have invited the fellows anyway, on my own say-so.
Think Danny and I are crazy to be the only fellows
in such an aggregation of girls?”</p>

<p class='c006'>At sight of the troop of joyful intruders panic
overtook two of the reindeer and they fled to the
safety of Miss Susanna’s protection. One of them
was Lucy Warner, who was noted for her bashful
fear of young men. The other was Neva Worden,
an equally timid dormitory girl. Neither would consent
to perform for the benefit of the newcomers.
Jerry and Ronny, in giggling distraction over this
unexpected hitch in the program finally posed them,
one on either side of Miss Susanna’s chair, ostensibly
as ornaments, while their six unabashed companions
sang a jolly English roundelay, at the same time executing
a lively little dance around the Lady of the
Arms, waving their antlers and jingling their bells.</p>

<p class='c006'>Phil, as the fiddler, presently came forward to
play for the dance Santa Claus had graciously announced.
Her usual picturesque style was intensified
by a costume consisting of baggy black velvet knickers,
a velvet coat of forest green with a skull cap to
match. Her white cotton blouse fell away from her
firm white throat in a wide rolling collar. Two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>peacock feathers were thrust through her cap.
Black stockings and brown suede sandals lent the last
touch of the artistic unusual to her. Her violin
swung from her shoulder on a broad green ribbon.
Her bright loosened hair under her tiny cap gave
her a thoroughly Bohemian appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tucking her violin under her chin she drew forth
the familiar marshalling strains of the Virginia reel.
She raised her head a little from her violin and
laughed softly as her quick ear caught the sound of
another violin besides her own. As she continued to
play a slim black-eyed boy with a shock of heavy
black hair thrown off his forehead came forward
from where he had been concealed behind the Christmas
tree. Under his chin was a violin. He was
playing the old reel in perfect time with Phil. This
was her introduction to Charlie Stevens, now a “big”
boy and qualified to play in “a big band.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna and Santa Claus led off in the reel.
The King of the North Pole followed with tiny Vera.
Leila accepted Danny Seabrooke as a partner and
Robin fell to Miles Burton. Ronny danced it with
Mr. Macy, who had come up to “see the fun,” and
Mrs. Macy danced with Harry Lenox. The rest
of the girls paired off with the remainder of Hal’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>delegation of Sanford boys, and the house rang with
the laughter and cheer of the occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie’s partner chanced to be Danny Seabrooke’s
brother Donald, a junior at Weston High.
As she stood between Leila and Barbara Severn in
the merry line of girls awaiting her turn to dance
she was reminded of the changes that had taken place
since the first time she had danced a Virginia reel in
the Macy’s ball room. She sorely missed Connie
and Laurie. This was the second Christmas Eve
without them. She recalled how she and Laurie and
Connie had worked to make a happy Christmas for
little Charlie when first she had known Connie and
him. Now here was Charlie, a tall, sturdy boy, with
not many years between him and manhood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three girls were missing tonight from the old
happy sextette. Connie, Irma and Susan Atwell.
Connie was far away across the ocean. Irma was
visiting her aunt in New York and buying her
trousseau. The Atwells had moved to San Francisco.
Harriet Delaney, the seventh chum the sextette
had invited into their close little band, had
made a successful New York debut in grand opera.
Mary Raymond, her first chum, had long been in
distant Colorado. And Mary was going to be married!</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>They were all dearer to her than ever, she reflected.
A warmth of fresh affection for her absent
friends surged up in her heart. Followed a sense
of tender exultation as she looked up and down the
rows of gay, voluable dancers. How very rich in
present friends she was! Present and absent, they
were all hers; to have and to hold. Surely love,
the love of which Hal had wistfully talked to her,
could not be more wonderful than friendship.</p>

<p class='c006'>Involuntarily her eyes strayed to Hal, vividly,
romantically handsome in his sparkling white regalia
of the frozen zone. “He looks like the hero of a
Norse myth,” was her thought. “When we go back
to Hamilton, I’m going to ask Leila to write a Norse
play and call it—” Marjorie deliberated. Her gaze
continued to rest unsentimentally on Hal as he stood
at the foot of the line, exchanging humorous sallies
with the two fiddlers. “The Knight of the Northern
Sun,” she decided inspirationally. “Gussie Forbes
can play the part of the knight. Her shoulders are
almost as broad as Hal’s.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Occupied with the fun of the moment, Hal failed
to note the admiring, concentrated gaze of the sparkling
brown eyes he loved best. He had resolutely
steeled himself to play the part for which Marjorie
had cast him in the drama of life—that of devoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>friend. Nor did Marjorie dream that in visualizing
Hal as a magnificent Norse knight she had challenged
a romantic side of her nature of which she had not
believed herself possessed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Miss Susanna awoke on Christmas morning with
the sound of fresh, young, tuneful voices in her
delighted ears. Her door stood half open which
explained why she could understand so clearly the
quaint words of the old Irish carol which floated up
to her on an harmonic tide from downstairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>She was so raptly engaged in listening she neither
heard Marjorie’s light step or saw her witching face
framed for a brief second in the half-open doorway.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Marjorie gleefully tiptoed down stairs to report the
awakening of the Lady of the Arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let us sing Brooke Hamilton’s favorite, ‘God
rest you merry, gentlemen,’ though it is one merry
little lady who will get no more rest in bed this day,”
Leila said drolly, after hearing Marjorie’s report.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You should have seen her! She was sitting
straight up in bed, looking so happy, and as though
she was loving the music. After we sing this carol,
I’ll take her breakfast up to her. After breakfast
we’ll escort her downstairs to see our tree and—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can’t lose me,” remarked a matter-of-fact
voice from the doorway. Miss Susanna trotted toward
the group at the piano, looking smaller than
ever in her warm, blue eider down dressing gown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So we notice,” laughed Vera.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I notice you have been booning, as the
Irish say, with Jeremiah Macy,” was Leila’s sly
comment. “Such slang!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something like that,” impishly returned Miss
Susanna. She showed marked enjoyment of her
own lapse into slang.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is your pleasure first, Lady of the Arms?”
Marjorie inquired, as she led Miss Susanna to a
brocade chaise lounge, the nearest seat to a gorgeous
heavily-laden Christmas tree.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Sing me his favorite carol.” Miss Susanna
gently tweaked one of Marjorie’s brown curls. To
please the girls she had allowed her curls to hang,
decorated by a pale pink satin topknot bow, which
matched her pale pink negligee.</p>

<p class='c006'>“With pleasure.” Marjorie dropped a light kiss
on the old lady’s hand, then joined the group at the
piano. Robin instantly touched the light opening
strains and started the stately English carol.</p>

<p class='c006'>They sang it as they had sung it many times before
with all the expression and animation of youth
for its old-world charm. When they had finished
Robin slipped from the piano stool with: “No more
carols after that for a while. <i>N’est ce pas</i>, Miss
Susanna.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Oui</i>,” responded the last of the Hamiltons
absently. She glanced immediately at Robin, however,
with her quick bright smile. “I will tell you
some day why it was his favorite carol,” she said.
“Not today. It is too sad a story for today. I
wish only to be happy while I am at Castle Dean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you’re going to be. The next happiness today
will be breakfast. You upset Captain’s and my
plan to serve it to you in bed. And the next happiness
after that will be our Christmas tree.” Marjorie
caught Miss Susanna’s hands and pulled her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to her feet with a frisky show of energy. She
placed light hands on the old lady’s shoulders and
marched her ahead to the dining room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Hamilton was the only late breakfaster, the
girls having been up and stirring early. Each had
had a mysterious visit to the drawing room tree to
make, there to deposit under its spreading branches
her own consignment of holiday bundles. Miss
Susanna’s consignment had been turned over to
Captain Dean with due secrecy, shortly after her
arrival at Castle Dean.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her bodyguard trailed faithfully in her wake to
the dining room there to supplement the breakfast
they had already eaten with sticky cinnamon buns
and coffee. “Not because we are stuffers,” Robin
carefully exonerated; “merely to keep you company,
Miss Susanna.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Afterward they went upstairs in leisurely fashion
to dress for the day. It was to be “a regular dress
parade,” each girl having brought with her from
Hamilton what she considered her prettiest afternoon
gown. General Dean had ordered assembly
in the drawing room at eleven o’clock sharp. He
had placed conspicuously in the hall a large notice
which stated:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“The Army is hereby ordered to appear in the
assembly room of the barrack at eleven o’clock A.M.
in full dress uniform. Any one appearing in forage
cap, sweater, boudoir cap or goloshes will be severely
disciplined. No carrying of canes, bumbershoots or
other civil impedimenta will be tolerated. Tardiness
and failure to comply with orders will be punished
by loss of presents. Forfeited presents will
be confiscated by General Dean as chief nabbing
officer of the day. Signed. <span class='sc'>General Dean.</span>”</p>

<p class='c006'>The worthy general himself presently appeared
and took a determined stand in the hall where he
could keep an eye on matters. Frequent ringing of
the door bell kept him occupied in hustling to the
door. Before long he had admitted Lucy, Kathie,
Ronny, Jerry, Helen, Hal, Charlie Stevens and
Muriel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upstairs Miss Susanna and the four girls wondered
as they completed their Christmas toilettes
what was the occasion for the treble shrieks of mirth
which invariably followed the opening of the heavy
front door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is that ridiculous general of yours up to
now, I wonder?” Miss Susanna said to Marjorie
and her mother, who had come into the old lady’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>room to admire her in the beauty of an imported
gown of wisteria satin, paneled and further embellished
with rose-patterned deep natural silk lace.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s find out this minute. Come, my fair lady
in silk and lace.” Marjorie crooked her arm invitingly
to Miss Hamilton. “Ready, girls?” she
called back, as the two began a buoyant descent of
the stairs, with Captain, smiling indulgently, in
their wake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Te, he, he,” Miss Susanna’s own special chuckle
was heard as she caught sight of General Dean.</p>

<p class='c006'>The high executive of military maneuvers of the
Dean Barrack had obeyed his own order to appear
in full dress. He wore a pair of leaf green trousers
and a scarlet uniform coat heavily trimmed with gilt
braid. On his head perched a bright green fez with
a long scarlet plume curving around it and far down
on one shoulder. Added to the plume a sprig of holly
had been neatly fastened on the front of the fez.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see nothing to laugh at,” he sternly reprimanded
the mirthful trio on the stairs. “I am giving what
I consider a faithful representation of the holiday
spirit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You look like a chocolate nut nightmare,”
Lieutenant Dean disrespectfully compared.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“I never saw one, so how can I possibly know how
I look.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A two-pound ration of chocolate nuts eaten before
Taps will introduce you to one,” retorted the
lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Two hours in the guard house for disrespect
to a superior officer,” penalized General Dean.
“Forward march. Don’t block the highway. Discipline
must be preserved in the Army. Three at
the head of the stairs—quick time, March,” he
rumbled as he spied Leila, Vera and Robin about
to descend.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Hamilton’s entrance into the drawing room
was the signal for a chorus of Christmas greetings
from the lively company now in possession of the
apartment. Jerry led her under the mistletoe bough,
which decorated the top of the indirect dome, and
kissed her on both cheeks. The others followed
her example.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have you done with your guests?” she demanded
of her affectionate callers. “I am surprised
at you for running away from them! What must
they think of you?” She drew down her small
features in exaggerated disapproval. Her bright,
bird-like eyes wandered from one to another of the
frolicsome group. She read pleasant, suppressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>excitement in every face. She innocently attributed
the cause of the mysterious, smiling air of the callers
to a probable delightful conspiracy on their part
against General and Captain Dean. She did not stop
to consider herself. She was of the grateful opinion
that she had been already surfeited with generous,
loving attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have to obey orders.” Lucy Warner volunteered
this over-solemn information. “‘Obedience
is a soldier’s first duty,’” she quoted tritely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When the bugle calls, et cetera, et cetera, you
know,” Jerry helped the old saw along. She waved
a plump hand by way of furthering her vague explanation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never heard a bugle call et cetera, et cetera,”
General Dean remarked in interested wonder. “I
shall investigate the matter as soon as I am off
duty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll help you,” offered Miss Susanna, to the open
and pronounced glee of the high executive officer.
“Such a phenomenon should be investigated.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We may need the services of these two civilians,”
General Dean airily indicated Hal and Charlie
Stevens. “Let me see. What was it we were going
to investigate? I have so many important matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>on my mind, I—” He grew cheerfully
apologetic.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t try to implicate us,” warned Hal.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please, sir, we’re only a couple of Christmas
strays,” Charlie Stevens rolled humorous black eyes
at Mr. Dean. He was still the droll youngster of
early childhood days, but now coming into a boyish
appreciation of the spirit of humor which always
prevailed in the little circle of young folks unconsciously
dominated by Marjorie’s friendly ways.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sh-h-h! I know it.” The General whispered
loudly to Charlie behind his hand. “I hadn’t intended
to mention it.” He elevated his heavy eyebrows to
an alarming degree. “Since you’ve given yourself
and your partner away you’d best try to become
social successes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Much obliged, old top.” Hal indecorously lifted
the General’s Christmas fez from his head, then
jammed it down again on the presiding officer’s
crown. “I’m going to offer the season’s greetings
to my little lavender Lady.” He and Charlie at once
began to pay extravagant court to Miss Susanna.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dean continued to buzz about among
the congenial little throng with a great deal of loud
remark concerning “the promoting of good behavior
in the Army.” At length he succeeded in seating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the animated, festive detachment to his liking. He
assigned Miss Susanna to the center of the gold
brocade chaise lounge and ranged Marjorie and
Leila on each side of her. The others he ordered
into an open group about the golden dais. Finally
he appeared satisfied. He crossed the room to the
gift tree at a magnificent military strut:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Attention,” he boomed in a voice so stentorian
it set the chattering formation to laughing.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE VIOLET GIRL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In spite of laughter the Army obeyed the command
with gratifying promptness. They stood up,
saluted; remained standing. Every pair of bright
eyes was fixed on General Dean. Only one pair,
however, betrayed curious speculation. Their owner
had suddenly become canny. Miss Susanna decided
the conspiracy was not against Mr. Dean, since he
appeared to head it. Captain looked as though
she knew all about it, too. The old lady concluded
with affectionate vexation that it must be against
herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dean had returned the salute. While the
Army still remained at standing he went over to the
Christmas tree and took from it a large, oval, canvas-wrapped
object. He loosened the canvas wrapping,
but did not remove it. Then he came forward
with it and took up a position still well away from
Miss Hamilton, but exactly opposite her.</p>

<p class='c006'>As he faced the sturdy little figure in the chaise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>lounge his levity dropped from him. “Miss Susanna,
the Eleven Travelers wish you a very merry Christmas,”
he said, his tone impressive in its pleasant sincerity.
“They have traveled far and wide in the
country of College to find a fitting expression of
their love for you. They now feel sure they have
found the one thing under the sun which will please
you most.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A sudden swift movement of one hand and the
enveloping canvas fell from the oval, plain gold setting
of a portrait. Life size and wonderful from
out of the oval frame smiled a lovely, familiar face.
There was a life-like quality about the portrait of
the beautiful girl in the violet-shaded evening frock,
with the huge bunch of purple English violets
pinned to the waist of her gown. It was so utterly
natural as to wring a sharp emotional little “Ah-h-h!”
from Miss Susanna. It claimed a united breath of
admiration from the others as well.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going to—to—cry, Marvelous Manager,”
quavered Miss Susanna. “I don’t—want—to—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cry right on Marjorie’s shoulder.” Marjorie
cuddled the old lady’s head against her breast. “Only
I’d rather you laugh.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I shall weep myself. Now I know why General
set me foreninst Miss Susanna,” Leila grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>unduly Irish. “Now for my tears, and I know I
can weep the loudest.” She sent out a sudden melancholy
banshee wail that raised a shout from the
Army and sent Miss Susanna into wild, hysterical
mirth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Start something jolly and keep it going,” counseled
Jerry of the other girls. “We won’t give her
a minute’s chance to be sad and splashy over beloved
Bean’s beloved portrait.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She stretched out a hand to Ronny, who took it
and offered Muriel her free one. Next minute she
had gathered up Mrs. Dean, Helen, Lucy, Robin and
Kathie. They took hands and pranced about in
front of the chaise lounge. Jerry led them vocally,
loudly and a trifle off key with: “Come choose your
east; come choose your west. These are the three
we all love best.” The dancers were soon singing it
at top voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dean, not to be outdone, hospitably
formed another prancing little circle with Hal,
Charlie and Delia, which gyrated so rapidly despite
Delia’s giggling protests, and executed such quaint
pas-seuls as to turn what might have been a tearful
moment into one of wild hilarity.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I couldn’t cry to save me,” Miss Hamilton
presently declared. “I’m glad of it. I hate tears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>as much as a man hates to see them. I shall love
my violet girl every day in the year, and hang her
in my room where I can see her first thing in the
morning; last thing at night. It is a magnificent
study, child. Who painted it? When did you ever
have time to sit for it?” The old lady showed decided
curiosity upon this point.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I posed for it at the beach last summer, Miss
Susanna. The Travelers thought you might like
it best of anything we could choose. It was Leila’s
idea. We planned it at Commencement. Raoul
Verlaine, a friend of the General’s, painted it. He
is famed for portraits. He was in Sanford after I
came back from Hamilton in the late summer. I
gave him the last sittings then. That’s all.” Marjorie
paused, overtaken by the sense of embarrassment
which visited her whenever she stopped to realize
that she had figured as the central object in the
affair.</p>

<p class='c006'>Placed upon a light easel which had held the
portrait since completion, the party of friends gathered
around it to admire afresh both the work and
subject. Marjorie, overwhelmed by her own importance,
left Miss Susanna’s side and slipped from
the room. She went into the living room, and,
standing at a window, looked out happily. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>was glad to forget herself in a rapt contemplation of
the wide snow-covered lawn, the tall bare trees, the
deserted pagoda; all her treasures of home. She
thought Miss Susanna could not love Hamilton Arms
better than she loved her own Castle Dean.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reminded that the tree was yet to be stripped of
its Christmas bloom, she turned from the window
to go back to the merry, buzzing company in the
drawing room. She slipped back into the room as
quietly as she had left it. General was calling for
attention and making ready to bestir himself as
a kind of military Santa Claus.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the way across the room to her father, who
was standing near the tree, Marjorie’s eyes came to
rest on Hal. He and Charlie Stevens were standing
back from the portrait in an interested viewing
of it. Charlie was talking animatedly and gesturing
like a foreigner. Hal was listening with apparent
gravity. In his face, as he viewed the portrait,
was an expression of repression that cut Marjorie
to the heart. It was the look of a man, smiling under
torture. She came into a new and depressing understanding
of the depth of Hal’s love for her.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Muriel Harding had gone home on the Christmas
vacation more puzzled than hurt over Doris
Monroe’s sudden swerve from affability to hostility.
It was not in Muriel’s easy-going nature to
trouble long over anything, no matter how serious.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since Marjorie had wished her to invite Doris to
go with them to Sanford she had promptly acquainted
her chum with “the Ice Queen’s return to the
glacial period.” When Marjorie had perplexedly
questioned “Why?” Muriel had replied with good-natured
impatience: “Why does it rain? Because
it does? Why is the Ice Queen? Because she is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>During the last two or three busy days before vacation
claimed them Doris and Muriel had employed
monosyllables in addressing each other. Of the two
Doris was the more greatly disturbed over the
strained relations she had brought about. She had
more real liking for Muriel than for any other
student on the campus. Underneath her cold, indifferent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>exterior she had a critical appreciation of
Muriel’s quick wit and extreme cleverness. The
majority of the students whom she graciously allowed
to admire her she took small interest in. Her
approach and Muriel’s toward mutual friendliness
had been very slow. It had progressed, however, in
spite of the groundless dislike she persisted in holding
against Muriel’s intimates.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had gone furiously out of the Hall to mail
the letter to Leslie Cairns vowing that she would
never speak to Muriel again. Her tempestuous
resolve was not so much the result of anger as of
wounded pride. What a poor opinion Muriel
Harding must have of her had been her chagrined
thought as she crossed the campus to the mail box.
Muriel had invited those wretched, beggarly off-campus
students to her home first. <i>She</i> had only
served Muriel as a last resort. Besides Muriel had
discussed her with Marjorie Dean; no doubt had
belittled her. Miss Dean had chosen to regard her
as a welfare problem. Very likely Miss Dean was
jealous of her because she had won the Beauty contest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though Doris did not suspect it the full-grown
soul she possessed was awakening and beginning to
clamor for attention. The true depths of her nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>were trying to rise and overflow her more superficial
side. Selfish indifference alone was the barrier
that stood between her and a fuller, freer, happier
college life.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had found the admiration she had been accorded,
first at the old-time hop, later at the Beauty
contest, far more satisfying than merely being
trotted about the campus by over-fond freshies as
a “crush.” There had been a spirit of fun and frolic
about both social affairs which had appealed to her
girlish imagination. She was only eighteen and in
spite of her bored, sophisticated air rather childish
at heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>For this very reason she had never really approved
of Leslie Cairns or her unscrupulous, high-handed
methods. She had been a little dazzled at
first by Leslie’s expensive clothes, lavish expenditures
of money and apparently boundless liberty. At
the time when Leslie had offered her the use of the
white car she had named the Dazzler, Doris had
felt some degree of liking for the ex-student of
Hamilton. She had more reluctantly accepted the
gift of the smart white costume and furs which
Leslie had insisted upon giving her. She had demurred
even more strongly against allowing Leslie
to open an account for her at the Hamilton Reserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Bank. Leslie had over-ruled her in the matter and
had deposited in the bank five hundred dollars to
the account of Doris Monroe. She had assured
Doris that she regarded the transaction as “a business
proposition.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her chief argument had invariably been: “Make
yourself popular on the campus and it will be worth
a lot more to me than a few dollars, togs or buzz-wagons.
I need you to keep me posted as to what
goes on at the knowledge shop. Leave Bean and
her Beanstalks alone, though. When I need news of
them you can get it in a roundabout way. I’ll help
you, and I’ll expect you to help me—when I need
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just what Leslie meant by frequent covert allusions
to a future day when she would need Doris’s
help was something Doris occasionally pondered.
She had firmly refused to interest herself in the
tentative proposal Leslie had once made that certain
anonymous letters should be written and sent to
Marjorie Dean. Since that occasion Leslie had
never suggested any other unscrupulous work for
Doris to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Doris accepted dinner and luncheons from
Leslie and allowed Leslie to pay for the upkeep of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the Dazzler, she was wary about spending Leslie’s
money. She knew her father would be righteously
enraged with her for accepting a penny from either
stranger or friend. Her own allowance was a comfortable
one for a girl of her age. The money she
saved by sharing her room with Muriel also augmented
it. She had a very fair wardrobe and had
therefore done no shopping in particular since entering
Hamilton. She developed no crushes. Consequently
she did not spend much money. She was
not mean or stingy in this respect. She was too
selfishly indifferent and too indifferently selfish to
care to give pleasure to others. Her beauty had
always demanded for her, and met no denial.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since she had come to Hamilton College she had
cherished two ambitions. The first had been
toward popularity. The second was to achieve a trip
to New York City. Popularity, because of her
beauty, had quickly found her. The trip to New
York had not been so easy of fulfillment. She had
hoped to go to New York with Leslie at Thanksgiving.
Leslie had disappointed her. More, she had
utterly discouraged the idea when Doris had defiantly
asserted that she would visit the metropolis
alone. Leslie’s half sincere promise to show Doris
about New York during the Christmas vacation was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>one on which Doris had fondly built. Her anger,
on hearing from Leslie that she did not intend to
fulfill the promise, had been so scathing as to cause
Leslie to reconsider and try to make peace with
wrathful “Goldie.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Muriel’s invitation had been offered at the psychological
moment in Doris’s affairs. The step in the
right direction which she had planned to take would
have wrought an admirable change in her before the
dawn of New Years. Instead Doris had received
a call from Julia Peyton which had completely uprooted
her healthily growing good will toward
Muriel and again thrown her upon the society of
Leslie Cairns for amusement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie had received Doris’s note with a silent hobgoblin
laugh and a contemptuous: “Pouf; I
thought she wouldn’t stay peeved.” Deciding to
keep the sophomore in suspense she had not answered
the note until the very last moment. It had reached
Doris on the morning of the day when college
closed for the holidays, leaving her barely time to
pack a trunk and arrange her affairs. Long since
determined on the New York trip at some time or
other, Leslie or no Leslie, Doris had saved a certain
sum each month from her allowance. She had not
therefore drawn on the account in Hamilton bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>for the trip, nor did she intend to do so. The very
sight of the bank book in the top drawer of her
chiffonier gave her a feeling of uneasiness. At the
time when she had burst upon the campus in her
white suit, furs and shining white car she had used
in the neighborhood of seventy-five dollars of the
sum in bank to her credit. Since then she and Leslie
had quarreled and bickered so much she wished she
had never used a cent of the five hundred. She
planned to return it from her own income after the
trip to New York was over.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you had let me know sooner what you
intended to do,” had been Leslie’s grumbling words
to Doris as the two met at the Hamilton station.
On receipt of Leslie’s belated note Doris had obeyed
its instructions to call Leslie on the telephone at the
Hamilton House. Over the telephone the trip had
been hurriedly arranged.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why didn’t you let me know?” had been the
ruffled sophomore’s strongly emphasized question.
“You could have answered my note sooner than you
did.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You should have written me long before you
did.” Leslie’s emphasis had been stronger and more
displeased than had Doris’s. “I told you before you
left me at the Colonial that I would go to New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>York. You never said a word. It’s your own fault,
Goldie, that you had to rush around like mad at
the last minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Such had been the discordant basis upon which
the two girls had met at a time when all the world
of light and love was pleading for “Peace on earth,
good will toward men.” Once they had settled down
in the train for the journey they had grown a trifle
more amiable. They were both too fond of pleasure
not to look forward to a two weeks’ stay in New
York. Leslie had soon miraculously recovered her
good humor and had proceeded to lay out a program
of amusements for the first week of their stay in the
metropolis. She had decided privately to “ship
Goldie back to the campus the day after New Years.”
That would leave her a few brief days in New York
alone to go about her own affairs. Time was flying.
She had difficult and important work to do
which must be done soon.</p>

<p class='c006'>She planned to humor Doris to a round of holiday
gaieties. They would dine and lunch at the
smartest restaurants and tea rooms. They would
occupy box seats at the theatres, and at the opera.
Leslie even considered introducing Doris to Natalie
Weyman. That would mean an entree for Doris
into New York’s most exclusive younger set. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>objection to this proposal was that Nat was “such
a snip when she was jealous.” Of course she would
be jealous of Doris. She was capable of “snubbing
Doris off the face of the earth.” That would mean
Doris in a towering rage again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie was not anxious to arouse a fresh spirit of
antagonism in Doris. The self-willed sophomore
was her only reliable source of campus information.
Besides, Doris was more truthful than the majority
of girls with whom she had chummed. She had also
the virtue of silence. Goldie could be trusted not to
“tell everything she knew, and a lot she didn’t know,
to the mob.” Like the majority of untruthful persons,
Leslie was quick to note and appreciate truth
in someone else. Again, she did not fancy losing
the companionship of the one girl intimate she had
at Hamilton. She had spent time, patience, effort
and money in cultivating Doris’s friendship. She
did not propose to be a loser.</p>

<p class='c006'>Beyond the usual brief letter which Leslie had
received every Monday morning from Mrs. Gaylord,
her obligingly absent chaperon might as well
have been a myth. Since Leslie had settled down for
a protracted stay in Hamilton, and at the Hamilton
House, Mrs. Gaylord had spent an enjoyable period
of visiting her relatives and friends. Leslie demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>a weekly letter from the chaperon. She
answered it only as she felt inclined. It had been
earlier arranged between them that, should anything
of moment occur suddenly of an adverse nature to
either, the other was to be immediately notified by
telegram.</p>

<p class='c006'>The one contingency which both feared was the
sudden wrathful interference of Peter Cairns. Such
a calamity must be shrewdly guarded against.
Neither was desirous of giving up an arrangement
which suited both so admirably. They had prepared
a telegram against the emergency. It was:
“Hamilton House Central.” It signified that they
were to meet in Hamilton at the Hamilton House
as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the Sunday before Christmas Leslie had seen
fit to write Mrs. Gaylord at Greenwold, where she
was visiting a friend, informing her of the proposed
trip to New York.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now don’t think you have to drop everything and
hit up a pace for New York,” she had written with
slang insolence. She had stopped to snicker after
setting down thus much as she pictured plump, dignified
Mrs. Gaylord proceeding on foot toward the
metropolis at racing speed. “My sophy pal, Miss
Monroe, and I, will stay at the Essenden. It’s exclusive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>enough to suit even P. G. He’ll never know
we’re there, so you should fidget. I shan’t look up
Nat. Deliver me from soreheads like her. At least
she would be one, if she saw me with a new chum.
That will cut out the society part, so don’t throw a
scare over that. I think the grand old grump is out
of town. Since he can’t see me in the family circle
I’d rather he’d sail across the pond and disappear
for a while. I heard he was going to London soon.
Don’t know. I’ll write you from New York. Do
as I say, and stay where you are, unless we have to
telegraph. Get me? L.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Although Leslie had put the pertinent proviso,
“unless we have to telegraph,” in her letter to Mrs.
Gaylord she did not anticipate any such contingency.
She had a comfortable conviction that her father
was probably too deep in his own affairs to think of
her. Mrs. Gaylord had not heard from him. She
was sure of that. Her chaperon had had instructions,
in case Mr. Cairns were to write her, to inform
Leslie of this by the statement: “X equals
the unknown quantity.” Safeguarded by what
Leslie chose to consider her own great cleverness,
she felt herself a match for even her financier
father.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Quite the contrary, Mrs. Gaylord did not share
Leslie’s optimism. She received Leslie’s characteristic
letter with lively misgivings. She knew she
had no right to accept a handsome salary from Peter
Cairns for chaperoning his daughter without living
up to the position to the letter. Prodding conscience
jarringly informed her that she had abused and was
now abusing the financier’s confidence in her. Should
he discover the fact he was more than likely to dismiss
her and make it hard for her to find another
such position.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had intended to return to Leslie at Hamilton
directly after the holidays, there to remain. She
had been growing daily more and more uneasy for
fear Peter Cairns might have discovered her delinquency.
Continued silence on his part seemed an
assurance that she had not been under a surveillance
ordered by him. She knew that he might resort to
such methods. He had engaged her privately to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>watch Leslie after Leslie had engaged her as a
chaperon. He was quite likely to keep in close touch
with her comings and goings.</p>

<p class='c006'>She thought it very rash and inconsiderate in
Leslie to go to New York with “one of those reckless,
hair-brained students” for company instead of
asking her to go. Mrs. Gaylord had no great fondness
for girls. Of the Hamilton students she had
met only Lillian Walbert, Alida Burton and Lola
Elster; not a representative trio of Hamilton girls.
She frowningly wondered who Miss Monroe was.
She had not been in Hamilton enough during the
fall and winter to meet Doris. She was now doubly
vexed because she was fond of New York. Much
as she enjoyed visiting among her small town friends
she liked better the life and stir of the great eastern
city.</p>

<p class='c006'>She at once wrote Leslie an indignant letter expressing
her displeasure at Leslie’s new move and
accusing her of taking an undue advantage of her
leniency. She was not sanguine that Leslie would
receive the letter before she started for New York.
She supposed it would have small effect upon her
if she should receive it. She knew that Leslie would
be furious with her if she took it upon herself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>go to New York and resume her duties of chaperon
when they were not welcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Gaylord had met Leslie’s father, Peter
Cairns, only once. He had sent for her to come to
his New York offices not long after Leslie had engaged
her as chaperon. She had walked through a
maze of shining mahogany furnished offices to one
behind the rest, plain and almost bare in its austerity.
There she had talked with the great financier, a
tall, broad-shouldered, gray-eyed man with a stern
mouth and a thatch of black hair tossed off his forehead.
He had said very little to her, but she had
understood precisely what he expected of her. She
had left the office feeling decidedly in awe of him.
She discovered afterward that was the only vivid
recollection she had of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Gaylord resignedly resolved to make the
best of the annoying situation and return to Leslie
as soon as her lawless charge should return to Hamilton.
She could only hope Leslie would not stay
in New York beyond New Years. What a selfish
girl Leslie was! She had not even wished her a
Merry Christmas. Suppose Leslie were to run
across her father in New York, and Mr. Cairns
should inquire for her? Mrs. Gaylord felt a kind
of chill go up and down her spine each time that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>particularly unpleasant supposition occurred to her
mind. There was only one grain of comfort. Leslie
would not let him know the true circumstances if
she could help it. It would be to her own interest
to protect those of her chaperon.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day after Christmas Mrs. Gaylord received
a letter which threw her into a panic of despair. It
was a three-line letter from Peter Cairns, in his own
black, jagged handwriting, ordering her to join his
daughter, Leslie, in New York, immediately. He
had also furnished her with Leslie’s address at the
Essenden, the exclusive apartment hotel at which
Leslie and Doris were registered as guests.</p>

<p class='c006'>The uncompromising brevity of the letter was
dismaying in itself. Not a word more than was
necessary to convey the order had been employed.
It contained neither address nor date. The envelope
bore a New York postmark. She assumed that it
had been written in New York. She had the office
address of the financier. He had given it to her
with the injunction that any letter which she might
feel called upon to write him should be sealed and
marked: “Personal, by order of Peter Cairns.” She
resolved to write him, explaining matters. She soon
found she could summon no satisfactory explanation
of her absence from Leslie. The financier had engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>her to watch over his daughter; not allow
her to do as she chose, regardless of convention.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Gaylord arrived in New York and at the
Essenden on the evening after the receipt of Peter
Cairns’ curt message. She was tired and cross after
her long journey and resentfully ready to tell Leslie
a few plain truths. Her one consoling thought was
that Leslie had had the good judgment to register
for herself and companion at the Essenden. It was
at least above the criticism of even Peter Cairns.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie had taken Doris to dine at the Luxe-Garins,
a vast marble pile of a hotel which New York boasted
as its latest triumph in hostelry. The two girls had
sallied forth to dinner in a hotel taxicab much to
Leslie’s disapproval. “There are a dozen cars in
our garage at the town house, and we own enough
others scattered about this burg,” she had said with
snappish resentment. “Just because my father—.”
She had stopped abruptly, recollecting in time that
Doris knew nothing of her estrangement from her
father.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doris, lovely in her crystal-beaded white frock,
which was Parisian, had attracted more attention at
dinner than any other woman in the room. She
seemed in truth a dazzling fairy-tale princess with
Leslie opposite her as a wicked wizard. Leslie had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>chosen to wear a white velvet gown, banded with
black velvet and fur. It had a beaded, oddly-cut
bodice and was bizarre in effect. It lent her a dark,
sinister appearance which Doris’s white beauty made
more noticeable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two girls had so much enjoyed the flattering
notice their presence in the luxurious restaurant
had created they dawdled over their dinner until
it was too late to go to the theatre. Both would
have liked to join the dancers on the perfectly polished
floor, but knew no one. Leslie had an odd excess
of family pride quite at variance with the rest of
her lawless nature. She could always be trusted
never to form acquaintances whose social standing
she did not know. When they had finished their
demi-tasse she marched Doris from the restaurant
like an attendant dragon without so much as a glance
at more than one plainly admiring young man. Leslie
cared nothing whatever about either sentiment
or young men. What she had enjoyed was the little
stir Doris’s golden beauty had created.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tomorrow, Goldie, we’ll go to luncheon at the
Gilbraithe. It’s a wonder of an eat shop. It’s the
spiffiest tea room I know in New York.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie made the announcement as they stepped
from the walk into the waiting taxicab. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>engaged a car from the Essenden for the evening
and had planned a ride up Fifth Avenue by way of
showing Doris a glimpse of the great city after dark.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll never get clear of that string of hay carts,”
she predicted, motioning her head in the direction
of the waiting line of automobiles. At the corner
above, where the line began, the starter was working
diligently to put the line in motion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doris merely glanced at her and again turned
eager eyes to the street. They sparkled with pleasure
as she took in the beautiful main entrance of the
white marble hotel at her leisure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, on the move at last.” Leslie gave a kind
of satisfied growl as she felt the taxicab begin to
move. It started, then came to a quick jarring
stop. The starter shouted out a sharp order. It
mingled with the chugging purr of the engine and
the voice of the taxi driver, raised to an incensed
yell at some progress-impeding object.</p>

<p class='c006'>With her usual impatience Leslie jerked open the
nearest door of the machine. She was too much of
a motorist not to investigate. Her driver’s start
had been blocked by a car which had been parked
in front of it. The driver of the other car had
boldly attempted to get under way first. She bent
forward and leaned far out of the open doorway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to see what was going on. The starter and her
driver had united in abusing “that fresh boob.”
She grinned sardonically as her driver flung a last
word or two at the disappearing car. With a sharp,
surprised “What?” she suddenly dodged back and
into the sheltering darkness of the tonneau.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the ornamental main entrance of the Luxe-Garins
she had spied a man emerging. He stood
before the great entrance doors briskly turning up
the collar of his brown fur motor coat and pulling
a brown fur cap down over his head as though preparing
for a high-speed spin. He was a tall man,
broad-shouldered, with gray eyes and a stern mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the dim cavern of the tonneau Leslie peered
out at him with a curious, reverend timidity. She
was careful to keep the ermine collar of her evening
wrap well up about her face. So her father was in
New York instead of Europe. Leslie watched him,
her dark features lighting to wistful admiration.
How she wished she dared open the door of the
car and call out to him! No; that could not be.
There was only one way to bring back his love for
her. That way was to work and win it. She drew
an audible sighing breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is the matter, Leslie?” Doris had heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>her companion’s surprised exclamation. Now she
heard the sigh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, nothing,” Leslie affected carelessness of
tone. Her gaze was still on her father. She kept
hungry eyes riveted on him as he left the hotel entrance,
swung down the broad stone walk and out
of her sight. “Did you notice a man standing in
front of the hotel with a brown fur coat and cap?”
She forced a casual question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; I didn’t. I didn’t notice anyone. I was
thinking about whether I liked New York better
than London. Of course I could never like it as
well as Paris. It is a wonderful city though,” Doris
said honestly. “I wish we knew some interesting
men here like the explorers my father knows. He
and I often have had luncheon and dinner with Jacques
Fandor, the great French explorer. Do you
know the man you asked me about, Leslie?” she
added with intent to be polite.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie did not reply at once. She hesitated for
a moment then said in an odd, repressed tone: “I
think I used to know him.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ONLY OBEYING ORDERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Will you kindly tell me why you are here?”
Leslie Cairns surveyed her chaperon, Mrs. Gaylord,
with an anything but welcoming face. “Didn’t
you understand my letter? It was written in English.
At least, I thought I wrote English.” Leslie
used sarcastic emphasis.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Leslie, your letter was in English, I suppose
your rude slang might be classed as English.”
The chaperon’s voice was bitingly dry. Her florid,
usually placid features were stiff with resentment of
Leslie’s cavalier manner. “You took advantage of
me in a most unfair way. Instead of writing me
that you thought of going to New York to spend
the holidays, you simply notified me at the last minute,
completely ignoring me as your chaperon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, cut out the lecture!” Leslie made a derisive
motion as though to push further rebuke from her.
“What is the matter with you? Doesn’t our agreement
hold good in New York as well as in Hamilton?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Couldn’t we have got together in a few hours
if necessary? I allowed for all that when I wrote
you. I didn’t think it urgent to put it down in
black and white. I gave you credit for having some
gray matter. Who engaged you in the first place,
my father, or I? He saw fit to butt in to my arrangement
with you. Of course I’m not supposed
to know that. Still it wouldn’t take me long to remind
him of it, if he began to be fussy with me.”
Displeasure of her father’s private understanding
with Mrs. Gaylord momentarily banished Leslie’s
regret of their estrangement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Leslie!</i> I hope you would not be so treacherous
as to let your father know that you—that he—that
you know he and I have a private understanding
about you,” stammered the chaperon in reproachful
alarm. “<i>That</i> is a secret agreement between him and
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was a secret, you mean,” satirized Leslie,
laughing with a kind of grotesque amusement. “A
secret isn’t much of a secret after it goes as far as
a third party.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Leslie!</i>” Mrs. Gaylord repeated the name with
exclamatory half-hearted wrath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, ‘Leslie,’” mimicked her amused charge.
“What’s the use of puffing, Gaylord? You know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>you always lose out with me in a talk contest. Sit
down, take off your hat and your head will cool off.
Registered at our village inn?” she raised ironic
eyebrows at her chaperon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; I have registered,” was the frigid return.
Mrs. Gaylord tried not to show approval of the
dainty Dresden apartment she was in. She had
caught only a fleecing glimpse of Doris. The latter
had promptly retreated to the bed-room she was to
occupy of the expensive Dresden suite of small
salon, two sleeping rooms and bath which Leslie
had extravagantly engaged. “I engaged a room with
bath on this floor, but—” She glanced about the
smart salon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No room here,” supplied Leslie. “Oh, you are
welcome, of course, to inhabit the salon with Goldie
and me,” she added flippantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you. You know, Leslie, that I have tried
not to stand in your way.” Mrs. Gaylord spoke
with reproving bitterness. “I am here now, not
because I wish to be, but because—” The chaperon
made an impressive pause.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now we are getting down to brass tacks.” Leslie
simulated genial encouragement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Gaylord frowned, but resisted bandying further
words. “Your father ordered me to come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>New York, Leslie,” she said with a direct simplicity
which had more effect on her discourteous charge
than had her air of affront.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What?” Leslie almost screamed the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the adjoining bed-room Doris heard the
cry and wondered. She knew that Leslie had a
chaperon, named Mrs. Gaylord, who amiably permitted
Leslie to do as she pleased. While she had
retired to her bed-room and closed the door, on the
arrival of the chaperon, she had caught enough of
the salutatory remarks between Leslie and the other
woman to establish Mrs. Gaylord’s identity in her
own mind. The fact that the caller had come at so
late an hour further convinced her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just what I say,” stiffly confirmed the chaperon.
“I received this letter from him. You might as well
see it.” She had opened her small seal traveling
bag as she spoke. Now she handed Leslie the letter
from Peter Cairns.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uh-h-h-h!” Leslie dropped down on a gilt-framed,
pale-hued Dresden settee with a pretense of
total collapse. Next second she sat up with a jerk.
“Gaylord, I beg your pardon for ragging you. You
seem to be a good sport,” was her half-humorous
apology.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Gaylord with difficulty maintained a grave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>face. Strangely enough, at heart she did not dislike
Leslie. Constant companionship with the financier’s
long-neglected daughter from the standpoint
of a duenna had shown her plainly all Leslie’s faults
and virtues. When first she had come to Leslie she
had resentfully labeled her as having all faults and no
virtues. Presently she discovered that Leslie was
generous, not of spirit, but in a material way. She
also had a virtue of minding her own affairs beyond
that of any other girl or woman of Mrs. Gaylord’s
acquaintance. Of Leslie’s intriguing, unscrupulous
side the chaperon knew little. She admired the girl’s
peculiar originality and thought her sayings distinctively
clever or funny. She respected Leslie for being
neither foolishly sentimental nor flirtatious.
Leslie’s rudenesses she soon learned to overlook because
Leslie was as civil to her as to anyone else,
perhaps more civil.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are you going to do about it?” Leslie inquired
with rueful curiosity. “He’s in New York.
I saw him last night in front of the Luxe-Garins.
Don’t think he saw me. I was in a taxi. Goldie
and I had been there to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You shouldn’t have gone there—just you two
young girls!” cried out the chaperon despairingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, stuff. I’m not a minor. Think the Luxe-Garins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>is a jungle full of black-whiskered lions
and unicorns? We didn’t dance, or speak to a soul.
We only had eats. That’s not a social blunder, is
it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No-o-o.” There was a certain amount of relief
in the reply. “I shall do nothing, Leslie. Your
father has ordered me to come here to look after
you. I am here. I thought before I came I would
write him and explain why we were not together.
I could find no proper explanation. I dare say he
is very angry with me.” Mrs. Gaylord’s tone grew
rather plaintive. “As your chaperon I should insist
on your compliance with strict convention at all
times. But it is as you say. You are not a minor,
you have the right to go where you please and do
as you please. Since your father has—well—has—.”
The chaperon halted lamely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cut me off his card index,” supplied Leslie with
forceful moroseness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both chaperon and charge had spoken louder than
they were aware. In the next room the last few
sentences of their talk had come clearly to Doris’s
ears. While she was not specially curious she could
not help being impressed by what she heard.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I had been like some of the girls I’ve known
I’d not have engaged a chaperon at all after he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>turned me down,” Leslie defended darkly. “I’m
supposed not to know he has ever showed a spark
of interest in me since he cut me out of his life.
Don’t you let him call you down because I told you
to visit your head off if you liked among your friends
while I was at Hamilton. You may tell him I hired
you and chased you away from me when I felt like
being alone for a while. He owes you a debt of
gratitude for telling me that he didn’t quite efface
himself from my map. Tell him,” she snickered
faintly, “that I pay you a salary for acting as a
friend instead of a priggish frump. Tell him he
ought to double your salary from his end of the
deal for the same reason.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why—Leslie!” Grateful amazement this time
prompted the chaperon’s exclamation. “I had no
idea you felt that way about me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had no idea myself,” Leslie retorted. She cast
a half sheepish glance toward Mrs. Gaylord. She
was experiencing the peculiar sensation of physical
glow which invariably attends the moral defense of
another person. For the first time in her wayward
career she felt moved to defend someone for whose
offense she was strictly to blame.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Gaylord took up her temporary abode at
the Essenden expecting at almost any hour to be
summoned to Peter Cairns’s offices or else receive a
call from him at the hotel. Neither the summons
nor the call came.</p>

<p class='c006'>Following her spirited moment of defense of her
chaperon Leslie returned to her usual half domineering,
always wilful manner. Since her father had seen
fit to order Mrs. Gaylord on the scene, she had decided
that the chaperon would be more of an asset than
a hindrance. Under Mrs. Gaylord’s wing she and
Doris could go about more freely to tea rooms and
hotel restaurants, and the theatres. They could stay
out later in the evening with a certain feeling of
assurance which neither had possessed during their
first evening venture into New York’s gaieties.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day after New Years Leslie announced to
her chaperon and Doris that she wished they would
go where they pleased and do as they pleased through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the days that remained to them of the Christmas
holiday, but without her company.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gaylord can show you the village as well as I
can; maybe better,” she assured Doris with a droll
twist of her mouth. “She won’t be peevish with
you. I would, if you made me sore, which you’d
probably do. I have special business to tend to here
in the next few days. It concerns my garage proposition
and is very important. I’ll hustle around
through the days so as to go out to dinner with you
in the evenings.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doris was as well pleased with Leslie’s new arrangement
though she kept her satisfaction carefully
hidden behind her politely indifferent features. She
and Mrs. Gaylord had grown friendly from the
start. The chaperon admired the sophomore’s unusual
beauty and enjoyed the covert appreciation it
drew wherever they went. She thought Doris’s
poise remarkably high-bred and was satisfied that
Peter Cairns could but approve of her as a friend
for his daughter. He was still in the city, she believed.
Leslie was of the same belief. “Don’t doubt
he knows our middle names and what time we come
back to the hotel every night,” was her shrewdly
humorous opinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The special business to which she devoted her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>days was typical of the intriguing side of Leslie.
While her father was presumably keeping an eye
on her, she was even more anxious to trace his movements.
She burned to know how long he intended
to stay in New York, and whether he was staying
at the family residence far out on Riverside Drive,
or at his club.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was another man, too, besides her father,
whose whereabouts in New York she was eager to
learn. He was a man to whom her father had more
than once intrusted certain business about which
she thought she knew a good deal. This man had
come to their home twice as a dinner guest. He was
tall, slim, with aquiline, foreign features, deep set
dark eyes and iron gray hair. She could recall distinctly
his courtly manners. What she could not
recall was his full name. It was Anton—. There
memory failed her.</p>

<p class='c006'>After she had unsuccessfully racked her brain for
the missing surname she came into startled knowledge
of a way to gain it. Dared she take it? Leslie’s
heart beat faster every time she thought about
it. She could not make up her mind to take it until
she had definite information concerning her
father’s plans. She decided that she would at once
try to obtain it from his offices.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>On the day after New Years she left Mrs. Gaylord
and Doris directly after breakfast and hurried
from the Essenden to start on the trail of the
“special” business. It was a fairly long drive from
the Essenden to her father’s downtown offices.
Leslie grew perceptibly nervous as she neared her
destination. There was no one to witness her uneasiness,
however. There was only one chance
against a hundred that she might encounter her
father. She could not imagine what she would do
if she were to come suddenly face to face with him.
And in this thought lay her inclination to panic.</p>

<p class='c006'>She arrived at last before the skyscraper, two
floors of which housed the executive and clerical
forces necessary to Peter Cairns’s several speculative
interests. Leslie ordered the driver of the taxicab
to wait and made a bold entrance into the building.
She could hear her heart begin to thump against
her side as she dodged into the cage of a waiting
elevator and dodged out again at the third floor.
Presently she had walked a little way down a wide
corridor and opened a door which in the past she
had opened many times.</p>

<p class='c006'>It led to an outer office, given over to the keeping
of a solitary office boy. When she inquired for
Mr. Carrington, one of her father’s important managers,
and gave the youngster her name, he stared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>at her with blue startled eyes and made a zealous
dash for a door leading to an inner office.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How are you, Mr. Carrington?” she drawled to
a clean-cut pleasant man of perhaps forty, who had
instantly emerged from the office to greet her and
now ushered her into his private business domain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well, Miss Cairns; thank you. And you?
It has been a long time since you visited these
offices.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes;” Leslie smiled affably. She was speculating
how long it might take to “pump Carrington,
and beat it.” “I was at college for several winters,
you know, and away from New York summers.
I’m not at the Riverside Drive house much. It
doesn’t pay to keep it open. My father is there so
seldom for any length of time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So he tells me. He doesn’t stay even in New
York for any length of time, for that matter,”
laughed the manager. “It isn’t an easy proposition,
getting hold of him when I need him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should imagine not.” Leslie smiled in apparent
sympathy. “Even I lose track of him for
days at a time. I am at the Essenden, at present
with my chaperon, Mrs. Gaylord. I came down
town this morning to see if you would help me with
a little steamer surprise I am planning to give my
father. That is, if he goes to England soon. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>thought you would let me know the day and hour
he’d plan to sail. Then I wouldn’t need to ask him
a single question, beforehand. He is likely to start
for England in a hurry without coming to the hotel
to say good-bye. Then where would my surprise
be?” Leslie put just the right amount of dejection
into the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, he has changed his mind about the trip to
England, Miss Cairns. He doesn’t intend to go
across the pond until he comes back from the coast.
That will be two weeks at least. I will let you
know, nearer the date of sailing,” was the pleasant
promise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The western trip? Oh, yes.” Leslie nodded
wisely. “I have no surprise ready for him for
that. There’d hardly be time for one, would there?”
she asked innocently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hardly.” The manager consulted his watch as
though amused at his own reply. “His car was
to pull out from the B. R. P. at noon today. It’s
almost noon now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean for the west; to the coast?” was Leslie’s
double question. It was asked with a drawling
inflection that nearly robbed it of interrogation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. Where shall I address you, Miss Cairns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>about the England matter?” Mr. Carrington questioned
courteously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At the Essenden. Thank you so much, Mr.
Carrington. You are always so kind to me. Not a
word to my father that I was here!” She raised a
playful forefinger. “You understand why.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Absolutely discreet, Miss Cairns.” The manager
raised a hand as though taking an oath.</p>

<p class='c006'>After a further brief exchange of pleasantries
Leslie rose to depart. She was in nervous haste to
be gone. It had taken “nerve,” according to her
way of thinking, to lead up to the information she
had sought, then to ask the right questions at the
right time. She had not devised until the last
moment a way of exacting secrecy from the manager
that would not arouse him to suspicion against her.
She knew that her father’s lieutenants of years were
chary of speech and still more chary of information.
It was evident that her father’s harsh stand in regard
to herself was not known in his offices. Since
Mr. Carrington did not know it, Leslie was sure he
did not, then none other of his staff of financiers
knew.</p>

<p class='c006'>She would have liked to ask Mr. Carrington to
give her the surname of the man, Anton. She remembered
that the manager had once dined with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>them on the same evening as the foreigner. She
had not dared ask about him. Nor did she believe it
would be wise to call again at her father’s offices
to interrogate Mr. Carrington further. She recalled
the old fable of the pitcher that went once too often
to the well and was broken. She did not intend to
risk losing what she had already gained. There was
still the other way of learning the name.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Leslie stopped for luncheon at an odd French
restaurant, the Fontainebleau. It was a Gallic
triumph in soft grays and rated as being more
Parisian than any other restaurant in New York.
After luncheon she ordered the driver of the taxicab
she was using to take her for a spin on Riverside
Drive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Keep on going out Riverside till I tell you to
turn around,” she ordered the man. “If you hear
me tell you to go slow, then go slow. I’m interested
in certain properties out on the Drive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Even by prosaic daylight Leslie felt a strange new
sentiment for New York which had never before
visited her. What a wonderful life she might have
in the splendid city of her birth if only she were her
father’s assistant. Perhaps she might be, and before
another year had passed. If she could successfully
carry out at Hamilton the project which was
now occupying her thoughts he would be forced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>admire her for her audacity and brilliancy. How
he would laugh at a certain feature of her undertaking.
Not unless she were clever enough “to get
away with it.” That was a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie’s swarthy features stiffened with stubborn
determination. This time there was to be no failure.
Her small dark eyes were engaged in keeping a
concentrated watch on the residences lining the Drive
as the taxicab slipped easily along on the smooth
paving.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be a great day for her when her father
forgave her and took her back into his confidence.
Before she devoted herself wholly to a career in
finance under her father’s generalship she would make
him take her for a long cruise to the South Seas in
his superb, clean-lined yacht, the <i>White Swallow</i>.
So Leslie promised herself as the car sped on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently she had come within pleasantly familiar
territory. Since earliest childhood she had seen the
palaces she was now passing. In them lived families
she had known and associated with as neighbors.
She had played with the girls and boys of these vast,
cheerless castles. They had all had the same dancing
masters; had attended one another’s parties.
They had later formed the younger set with whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>she had moved socially. Like herself many of them
lived only to please themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>There it was; her old home! It was the house in
which she had been born; the house from which her
mother had passed to Heaven, leaving behind a baby
girl to be brought up by nurses and governesses and
surfeited with riches out of all healthy proportion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie snatched the speaking tube from its accustomed
place and called through it to the driver.
“Slow down,” she ordered, “but keep on going.”
She had spied the house from a distance of half a
block away. In consequence the driver had begun
to slacken speed before the machine had passed the
“show shop,” as Leslie had whimsically named her
home because of its ornate splendor of architecture
and breadth of rare-shrubbed lawn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go ahead and park,” she again ordered through
the speaking tube. “Any place along here will do.”
The instant he had obeyed her and brought the
machine to a stop she hopped out of it and quickly
gained the sidewalk. The Cairns’s residence took
up a half of one block. Another massive gray stone
residence claimed the remaining half of the same
block.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank fortune,” she muttered as she strolled
along at the slow swagger she affected. “There’s no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>place like home, Leslie, old top. Peter the Great can
lead a merry life at the show shop, but <i>I</i> should
fidget, for all <i>he</i> cares,” was her bitter reflection.
“Rather that than see the place boarded up like a
disused barn. Gee whiz! Then I would have my
troubles. Wonder how much of the menagerie is
at large inside?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie paraded up and down the entire block several
times. From the street she could see nothing
about the exterior of the house to challenge her interest.
An ornamental iron fence squared the Cairns’s
property. The entrance gates were closed, apparently
locked. She stopped before them during one
of her patrols and pretended to lean against them.
As she did so she investigated them. They were
securely fastened.</p>

<p class='c006'>She stood eyeing them with sullen dismay, her
forehead corrugated by a deep scowl. Of a sudden
she appeared to have laid hold of a forgotten fact.
Her brows cleared like magic. Thanks to a crafty
provision against such an emergency in time past
she could cope with this latest obstacle.</p>

<p class='c006'>She lingered at the gates as long as she thought
prudent, her avid glance roving from point to point
of the house, searching for signs of the servants
about the place. She smiled grimly to herself as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>she recalled how often in her childhood days bright-eyed
groups of “common kids” would pause on the
sidewalk outside to peer wistfully through the iron
interstices of the fence at the spring glory of crocuses,
hyacinths and tulips which graced the Cairns’s
garden beds in colorful, fragrant loveliness. How
contemptuous she had been of the famished little
beauty worshippers! Now she was “on the outside,
looking in.” She was “on the wrong side of the
fence.” She was “barred out” of the show shop as
effectively as had been “those common kids.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A STRANGER IN THE HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Next day Leslie repeated the visit to her home.
The second expedition to it was made in a small
black car which she boldly requisitioned from a
garage located not far from her father’s offices.
There he kept several cars, immediate to the use
of himself and one or two of his lieutenants.</p>

<p class='c006'>The call Leslie had made at her father’s offices
had proved advantageous to her. She had not only
gained important information from Mr. Carrington,
she had also received a fresh supply of temerity to
bolster her for further daring deeds. She knew
the manager of the garage to which she went only
slightly. He had treated her request with the respect
due Peter Cairns’s daughter. She calculated
there was small possibility that the proprietor and
her father would ever discuss her visit to the garage.
She preferred that risk to the annoyance of
being watched by a curious taxicab driver.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the second occasion she was free to park her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>own car. She made one deliberate patrol of the
block. Then paused before the gates. From a pocket
of the leather motor coat she wore she pulled a
heavy medium-sized brass key suspended from a
brass ring. Without an instant’s hesitation she
fitted the key to a fat brass padlock which secured
the gates against intruders.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whuh-h-h!” Leslie blew a breath of relief.
“Easiest thing I ever tried to do,” she murmured
with satisfaction. “Wonder who’s home, or if anyone
saw me?” She drew the key from the open padlock,
fastened it in place from the inside of the gates
through which she had just triumphantly passed and
snapped it energetically back on guard. “This time,”
she laughed her silent selfish laugh, “I’m on the inside,
looking out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In spite of her bold manner and ready laughter
Leslie was experiencing a certain amount of trepidation.
She fought it down with all the sternness
she could summon against herself. The night before,
long after Doris and Mrs. Gaylord had retired,
Leslie had sat at a little table in her room arranging
the peculiar expedition to which she had now
committed herself. She had drawn a sketchy little
plan of the first and second floors of her home. With
a lead pencil she had lightly traced on the plan precisely
the course by which she would proceed when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>she had once passed through the vestibule of her
home and had set foot in the great entrance hall
with its lofty ceiling and grand stairway.</p>

<p class='c006'>Knowing her father’s secretive nature she was
reasonably sure that such of the servants as might
be in the house knew nothing of the strained relations
between herself and her father. Parsons, the
steward, might be there, possibly the second cook
and two or three of the maids. The others had
probably been sent to the country house on Long
Island which was never closed. When in or near
New York, summer or winter, this was her father’s
favorite haunt.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie had resolved to brazen matters out, if,
when she entered the house, she should suddenly
encounter any of the servants. Her objective was
a certain room on the second floor. It held something
she wanted; needed; must have.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go to it,” she mutteringly encouraged the reluctant
side of her brain. With this spur to action
she sauntered away from the gate and up to the
short drive which soon curved to the left and continued
on to the garage behind the house. She left
the drive for the wide stone walk leading up to the
deep, central pillared veranda. Her cool, self-possessed
manner, her walk, indifferent, swaggering,
was at variance with the excited beating of her heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and her private distaste for the visit she was about
to make. This distaste was not of moral persuasion.
Leslie was merely afraid that her father might have
changed his mind about going west at the last minute.
It was “Peter the Great,” not the servant she
dreaded encountering. If her father were afterward
to learn from any of the servants whom she
might encounter of her visit to the house, it would
show him that she was a force not easy to control.</p>

<p class='c006'>To gain access to the house itself would be a
simple matter since the doors and windows had not
been sealed. Leslie had several latch keys on a
special ring which fitted various doors of her stately
home. She was well prepared, but chose to use the
main entrance for the sake of appearances, should
she be observed.</p>

<p class='c006'>She stepped presently into the great rosewood reception
hall with its vast crystal sheet of mirror,
occupying the whole lower end of the apartment;
its two grim guardian Norman suits of armor. A
richly cushioned bench extended the length of one
side of it. Leslie paused beside the bench, listening
for sounds of human presence other than the
thump of her heart and the excited sigh of her
own breath. Not a sound disturbed the church-like
quiet which pervaded the hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>She dropped down on the bench and carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>restored to a small leather handbag the latch key
she had just used and which she still held in one
hand. For as much as ten minutes she sat still,
watching, waiting, listening, hoping no one might
come. During that time her eyes roved ceaselessly
about the hall and from the magnificent archway,
lightly draped with velvet of a rosewood tint, to a
lower smaller arch at the rear of the hall which
stood open into a sun parlor.</p>

<p class='c006'>She rose, at length slipped silently as an Indian to
the grand archway and made a comprehensive survey
of the French salon beyond the arch. Satisfied
that no one was there to spy upon her she next inspected
the sun parlor. There her father always
established himself in the morning, when at home,
with the morning papers. The long mahogany
library table was stacked with an orderly array of
newspapers and magazines. That in itself was
significant proof to Leslie that “Peter the Great”
was “missing from the show shop.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Without pausing to explore further the main floor
of the house she turned and darted noiselessly back
into the hall and up the grand stairway. Straight
as an arrow she directed her steps on reaching the
second floor landing to a wide solid looking door
of black walnut which stood part way down a short
wide corridor hung on both sides with nothing but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>marine paintings. It was Peter Cairns’s famous
marine collection; the pride of his heart. Leslie
ran her fingers up and down one side of the knobless
black walnut door. Silently it slid to the left,
disappearing into a space cleverly designed to receive
it. She was across the threshold in one long
step and the door was moving back into place again.</p>

<p class='c006'>This time she indulged in a burst of silent merriment
as she collapsed into an immense leather arm
chair. She “had got away with it.” She was now
safe from any possible intrusion of servants. She
was in Peter the Great’s own den. No one other
than they two knew the secret mechanism of the
walnut door. When she left the house it would be
by a private stairway leading directly to a side
veranda which no one but herself and her father
ever used. She had not been able to enter by this
means. There was only one key to the veranda
entrance to the stairway and this was carried by
the financier. The long room behind the walnut
door, furnished comfortably rather than luxuriously,
was Peter Cairns’s den. In it were his rarest
books, a collection of priceless ancient coins, one
of cameos, and numbers of unique treasures picked
up in all parts of the world. Leslie could open the
door from the inside by manipulation of a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>steel knob, like that of a safe. The door would
close after her, securing itself automatically.</p>

<p class='c006'>When her flash of victorious amusement had subsided
she let her gaze travel slowly about her.
Quickly her features changed to a somber cast. She
was once more in the good old “playroom” of happier
days. It was in this very room that she had
best learned to understand her father. Peter Cairns
had then treated her more as though she were his
son instead of his daughter. Her grotesquely plain
little face and lawless domineering ways as a youngster
had appeared to please and entertain him. He
had called her his “ugly little beauty kid” and “the
boss” and “Cairns II.” He had, as she had grown
older, and come home from prep school, then college,
spent long hours with her in the den. Sometimes
they had played chess or backgammon of
which they were both fond. Again he would talk
freely to her of his financial operations. It was a
school into which the maxims of Brooke Hamilton
would not have fitted. Peter Cairns had made Leslie’s
mind up to his own way of living as he was
one day to learn.</p>

<p class='c006'>Realizing the flight of time she gathered herself
together for the final episode of her surreptitious
errand. She rose, crossed the room to where a rare
etching hung and lifted it from its hook. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>space thus left vacant showed the indentation of a
wall safe. Leslie manipulated the tiny knob with
sure fingers. She next pulled open the safe’s door
and moved a tiny switch inside the cavity. A bright
light flooded it. She ran a finger down a stack of
small, black, leather-bound notebooks, bindings out,
lettered in gilt, A to Z. She drew the third book,
I to M, from the little pile and sat down with it
in the nearest chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So that’s his name—Lavigne! It sounds French,
but he looked more like a dago. He’s probably forgotten
his real name,” Leslie mused satirically.
“All right, Anton. I’ll proceed to tell your fortune.
You are going to receive a visit from a dark woman
who knows all about you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie copied the address from her father’s very
private directory into a note book of her own. She
replaced the little black book, closed and locked the
safe and made business-like preparations to depart.
She purposed to call at the address she had obtained
that same afternoon. It was not yet four o’clock.
She could reach Anton Lavigne at the Central Park
West address in good season if she started promptly.
If he were not at home she would leave a note
of appointment with him for ten o’clock the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c006'>She let herself out of Peter the Great’s den by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>curtained door at the back of the room. It also
had a spring lock, its key was also in the financier’s
possession. The stairway was in darkness but Leslie
knew her way without switching on a light at the
head of the stairs. Sure-footed, she quickly made
the descent and went cautiously onto the veranda.
Still no one in sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie kept as close to the house as she could until
she reached its front. There she crossed a strip
of frozen lawn to the drive and hurriedly followed
it to the gates. She could hardly believe as she got
back into the car that she had spent over an hour
in the show shop without having seen sign of a
servant. The house was in perfect order. She was
confident that Parsons was still caretaker. She had
seen signs of the steward’s expert domestic management
as soon as she stepped inside. She moodily
wondered when she would see home again. She
afterward brightened a little under the dogged determination
to “make things come her way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When she reached the somewhat garish apartment
hotel which housed Anton Lavigne she was
of the opinion that her good fortune had held. She
received the cheering information that Mr. Lavigne
was in and was soon shaking hands with the dark-faced,
suave, but keen-eyed foreigner. He came
downstairs to the lounge to greet her and conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>her to the family apartment on the fifth floor. He
inquired with the courtliness Leslie so well remembered
in him for her father. He had not seen or
heard from him in some time. He waited with admirable
reserve for Leslie to state her errand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My father is away from New York at present,”
Leslie began when he had ushered her into a small
reception hall furnished in a manner which suggested
its use as office as well. “I am through college
now and starting a business career for myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed,” Lavigne raised polite commendatory
brows. “May I ask, how long you have been engaged
in such an enterprise. You American girls
are so amazing. The English girls, too, for that
matter. In France every woman is a business
woman, so we say, but American girls are the business
adventurers. They plan business on a large
scale, and really accomplish what they plan.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope I shall,” was Leslie’s fervent reply. “My
father isn’t helping me at all. I don’t wish him
to do so. I am using my own money, and he isn’t
giving me a word of advice. All I claim from him
is a free use of some of his most private successful
methods. That is why I am here. I know you can
be as useful to me as you have been to him.” She
suddenly fixed her eyes on Lavigne with an expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>startlingly like that of Peter Cairns, though
she bore small physical resemblance to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You speak with great confidence—with frankness.”
Lavigne’s thick dark brows drew together.
“I knew when you were announced that you wished
something out of the usual. Only your father, Mr.
Peter Cairns, and a few of my special friends have
this address.” He gazed steadily at her as though
waiting to hear a certain assurance from her which
his foreign mind toward caution demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have just come from the house on Riverside
Drive. I took your address from its usual place.
Do you get me?” Leslie spoke in the best imitation
of her father she could muster.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, yes.” There was relief in the response. “I
understand the situation, I believe. What can I do
for you, Miss Cairns?” It had long been known
to Lavigne that Peter Cairns’s greatest interest in
life was his daughter. Such a calamity as an
estrangement between the two would have seemed
impossible to this man who had been one of the
financier’s ablest allies for many years. He now
believed that his best interests lay in serving Leslie.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie could tell nothing of the man’s thoughts by
watching his face. No expression or emotion contrary
to Lavigne’s will was allowed to appear on his
dark features.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“My business operation is the building of a garage
not far from the campus of Hamilton College.
Hamilton is my—er—the college I went to.” Leslie
always stuck at the words “Alma Mater.” “I
had a good deal of trouble obtaining the site, due
to the underhandedness of a crowd of would-be welfare
students who tried to make me give it up to
them. They wanted it for a dormitory.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lavigne smiled with heartening sympathy and
made a gesture of understanding regret for Leslie’s
troubles.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I found out what their scheme was and managed
to get into touch with the owner of the property
before they did. Before he closed with me they
let him know they wanted the site and he charged
me sixty thousand dollars for what I should have
paid not more than thirty-five or forty thousand.
When they discovered I had won out over them they
made a great fuss. They circulated very hateful
gossip about how dishonorable I was, and so forth.
A rich old crank at Hamilton, the last of the Hamilton
family, sided with these students against me,
though she’d never met me, and presented them
with a dormitory site right next to the property
I had bought. Can you beat that?” Leslie had
forgotten dignity in slangy disgust for the way the
matter had turned out.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Incredible, yet true.” Lavigne lightly raised a
hand. “But proceed, Miss Cairns. I am deeply
interested.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie went on to explain regarding the old
houses standing on both pieces of property. “These
students have the advantage of the services of the
only builder and architect of ability in that part of
the country. He knows the labor situation there. He
has had plenty of men since the start. I have a
New York firm on the job and they are slackers.
They claim they can’t get the laborers. My ground
hasn’t been cleared off yet. My garage building isn’t
started. The old dormitory is half up. I must do
something about it. Two-thirds of those laborers
are Italians, from an Italian colony outside Hamilton.
I want them to work for me. I’ll pay them
double, triple, if necessary, to quit the other operation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She stopped. Not for an instant did her gaze
leave Lavigne’s face. He was now looking at her
very shrewdly, an odd gleam in his black eyes. Leslie
thought they twinkled. It put her on her mettle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This isn’t a schoolgirl quarrel I’ve had with these
other students, Mr. Lavigne,” she said a trifle sullenly.
“If you want to know the secret truth it’s
a fight between another student and myself for—to
bring about a certain result. I have as much right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to the use of these men as she—as they—these students
have. I don’t care what I pay you to have
you help me. I have a large fortune in my own
right. I can soon prove it to you. This business
is really a race to see which side wins. I’ll win,
if you’ll help me. No one need even suspect you
of being concerned in the matter. I want you to
engineer it. That’s the way you’ve always worked
for my father, isn’t it?” Leslie asked the question
with innocent ingenuousness. She understood,
however, precisely how much depended upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your father’s and my transactions have always
been conducted with great discretion,” was the indirect
admission.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know that. I know <i>all about certain deals between
you and him in the past</i>. If I didn’t, would
I be here now? It’s not simply a question of the
garage operation with me. I’m fighting to assert
myself. I’m going to follow my father’s methods.
They’ve been absolutely successful. What I want
I intend to get, if those who can give it to me are
willing to sell out.” Leslie asserted boldly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, of course. You are like your father.
You are not a minor, Miss Cairns?” Lavigne inquired
tentatively.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hardly.” Leslie smiled. “And you don’t have
to consult my father. He has told me to do as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>pleased with my own money. I’ll ask you to observe
absolute secrecy in the matter. When the
battle is won, then he is to be told.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You may trust me to serve you as best I can,
Miss Cairns,” Lavigne declared with flattering sincerity.
“In a few days I will go to Hamilton and
look over the situation. I can tell you then what
ought to be done. Where shall I address you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“At the Essenden until day after tomorrow. Then
I’m going back to Hamilton. My address there is
the Hamilton House.” Leslie rose to conclude her
call. She was reminded that her father’s interviews
with others were always brief. She was experiencing
all the sweetness of vengeful exultation. At
last she was going to “get back at Bean.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MARJORIE’S CALLER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I thought you were never coming back, Jerry
Macy!” Marjorie dropped into the depths of the
near-by arm chair with a weary little flop. “I’ve
worked like mad for as much as an hour getting up
my share of the eats for Ronny’s birthday spread.”
She poked out her red under lip and tried hard to
look aggrieved. The sparkle in her eyes contradicted
the pretence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How could you harbor such disloyal thoughts of
me, Beautiful Bean? You are beautiful, even if
your lip is away out of place,” Jerry tenderly assured.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Being beautiful doesn’t make me feel rested.”
Marjorie still searched for cause to complain. “For
why did you stay away so long, Jurry-miar?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s the cause of my lingering longering.”
Jerry held up a good-sized pasteboard box tied
with stout string. “Just wait till you see it. I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to toddle all around Hamilton in search of a cake.
When all seemed lost we bumped into this glorious,
scrumptious cocoanut layer cake.” She set the box
on the table and untied the string.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a white splendor.” Marjorie stood beside
Jerry peeping at the cake as her chum removed the
box lid. “I’ve made the sandwiches.” She nodded
toward a side table carefully covered with a snowy
lunch cloth. “I cracked the walnuts for the brown
bread ones and also my thumb.” She ruefully put
the injured member in her mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How you must have suffered!” Jerry solemnly
exclaimed. Both girls began to laugh. “Leila was
in one of her fine frenzies because we couldn’t find
a real cake or any stuffed dates.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was that,” notified an affable agreeing voice
from the opened door. “Did not the people of
Hamilton all have their mouths set for sweet cakes
today?” Leila closed the door and joined her chums.
“We could find nothing we wanted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Until in despair we went over to a new bakery on
Gorman Street that just opened yesterday. The
woman who keeps it is German. She has yellow hair
and looks just like a pound cake,” Jerry described
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And our dream of a cake was in the window!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>exclaimed Leila. “We thought we would eat it ourselves
and tell no one, but we have such honor about
us. We could not bear to think of those who would
have no cake.” She smiled broadly upon Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are a pair of fakes. You’ve been out having
a fine spin while I’ve been in working hard.
The minute dinner’s over you two may make the fruit
salad. That will be your job,” Marjorie sternly
pronounced sentence on the buoyant, hilarious pair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will make forty fruit salads to please you,
Beauty, though I do not know how to make one.
Behold in me a helpful Harper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean a harpful helper,” corrected Jerry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you mean I am a harp, then I must tell you
you are right. I do not know how you guessed it.”
Leila gazed at Jerry in mock admiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dinner won’t mean much to us tonight,” commented
Marjorie as she proudly raised the lunch
cloth to allow the girls to see the tempting generous
stacks of small, three-cornered sandwiches, the
relishes and various other toothsome viands always
welcomed by girlhood at a spread. “Remember, we
are to take nothing but soup at dinner. It’s to be
cream of celery. I asked Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Marjorie, I almost forgot to tell you,” Jerry
suddenly cried out. “Something has happened to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Hob-goblin’s Folly.” This was Jerry’s pet name for
Leslie’s garage enterprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Happened?” Marjorie’s question contained little
interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yep. There’s a new gang of men at work on
the garage. Leila and I noticed them when we went
to town. They were gone when we came back, but
it was after five-thirty. There were as many as your
gang on the dormitory. I think they were Italians.
Don’t you, Leila?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leila nodded. “They must be a new addition to
the Italian quarter,” she surmised. “Signor Baretti
said last fall that nearly all the men of the quarter
were working on the dormitory. He said they had
refused to work for Leslie Cairns’s builders. They
would not pay them enough by the day. Perhaps
the new ones are glad of the work. But how can
I judge when I am no boss of Italians, or of any
one but Midget. I shall certainly give her a tart and
terrible lecture when I see her again. I left her entertaining
Gentleman Gus. Now I believe they have
eloped.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leila’s dark suspicion of Vera set the three girls
laughing. Gussie was the tallest girl at Wayland
Hall and Vera the tiniest. The elopement of the
pair was a joy to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“I haven’t been near the dormitory for three whole
days,” Marjorie confessed ruefully. “I’ve been so
busy since we came back from Sanford trying to
make up for a lot of things I let slide before I went
that I’m a no good manager. Robin is coming early
tonight, so she’ll know what has been going on
over there. We may thank our stars we have such
a splendid manager as Mr. Graham to look after the
dormitory for us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And such a Marvelous Manager as Bean to look
after the sandwiches for us,” supplemented Jerry,
imitating Marjorie’s tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thank my stars they’re made, and made without
your help, Jeremiah Macy.” Marjorie waved a finger
before Jerry’s face. “There’s Robin now, I’m sure.”
She sprang from her chair and ran to the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Were you at the dormitory today?” Her lips
framed the question before Robin had more than
stepped into the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No-o.” Robin’s tone was one of self-accusation.
“It’s neglectful in me, but I’ve not been there since
day before yesterday. I must turn over a new leaf
tomorrow. What about you, Dean? I know you’ve
done better than I.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I haven’t,” Marjorie protested. “I’m a day
behind you, Pagie. Jerry and Leila saw Leslie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Cairns’s builders have at last gathered up a supply of
workmen. The girls noticed them today when they
drove to town.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her garage will be about as successful there as
it would be in Thibet,” predicted Robin scornfully.
“It’s too far from the campus to be convenient.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder if she intends to run it herself?” remarked
Jerry. “I can see the Hob-goblin proudly
marching around her own car roost.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Conversation about Leslie Cairns came to a halt
with Jerry’s remarks. None of the Travelers liked
to discuss her. When they did it was because of
some way in which her affairs chanced to touch
theirs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lively entrance into the room of the “elopers”
who had gone for a ride in Vera’s car, and returned
at the last minute before dinner, brought a welcome
diversity of subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you care whether we have dinner or
not? Think of the spread we have for Ronny.”
Jerry reminded them. “You may have only soup
for dinner. We’re going to have the eats soon after
the party begins so that nightmares won’t be popular
along the hall tonight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You try to be kind-hearted, don’t you, Jeremiah?”
said Vera, with a patronizing smile.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Oh, yes, I try,” mimicked Jerry. “It’s not my
fault if my kindheartedness doesn’t register. Some
people are positively thick, and—”</p>

<p class='c006'>The ringing of the dinner gong sent Vera and
Gussie scurrying to their rooms to remove their
wraps. Marjorie, Jerry, Leila and Robin made
leisurely way down stairs to the dining room. Dinner
began and ended with soup for the Travelers.
The ten original Travelers were invited to the spread,
as were also Phil Moore and Barbara Severn.
Marjorie had invited both of the latter to come over
early to “soup.” Both had nobly refused in favor
of study so as to be free to spend the evening at
Wayland Hall without including “unprepared” in
next day’s vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The first thing for us to do to start the party is
to move the eats into Ronny’s and Lucy’s room.”
was Marjorie’s brisk decision, as she and Jerry returned
to Room 15 from the dining room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Robin had strolled down the hall to see Ronny and
give her a birthday present of a curious, vellum-bound
book in Spanish, which she had commissioned
her dilettante uncle to buy for her in Washington
at a fancy price.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We might all heave-ho and lug the table into the
other room with the eats on it,” proposed Jerry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>dubiously. “On the other hand, there might be a
grand heave-ho-ing of eats on the floor. I don’t
like to take such a risk, Bean. Think of my goloptious,
celostrous cocoanut cake.” Jerry had added
“goloptious” to her new vocabulary of one word.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Think of my scrumptious, splendiferous sandwiches,”
retaliated Bean with promptitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m thinking about them,” Jerry said mournfully.
“I could eat one now, if I had it. So near and yet
so far.” She lifted the lunch cloth and made eyes
at the stacks of sandwiches. “This is the result of
only soup for supper. I yearn to gobble the spread.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll feed you a sandwich with my own hand.”
Marjorie proffered a nut sandwich, Jerry’s favorite
kind, to her hungry roommate.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks, kind lady. I wasn’t—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know all about you,” cut in Marjorie with an
unsympathetic laugh. “Hurry up, and eat that sandwich.
Then help me move the eats; by hand; not by
table.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie went to the door and opened it. She
came back to the table, picked up two plates of
sandwiches and started with them for Ronny’s room.
Part way to it she encountered Annie, one of the
maids.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Oh, Miss Dean, I was just coming after you.”
The maid’s broad good-humored features broke into
a pleased smile. “There’s a gentleman down stairs
in the living room wants to see you.”</p>

<div class='pbb'>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>“WE MUST WORK TOGETHER”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“A gentleman to see me?” Marjorie repeated
wonderingly. She turned a look of mild inquiry
upon the maid. “Didn’t he give you his name,
Annie?” Marjorie’s thoughts at once flashed to her
general. Perhaps he had come to Hamilton to give
her a surprise. Business might have brought him
near the campus. Her cheeks flushed. Her eyes
sparkled at the fond thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Please, Miss Dean, I asked him his name once
and he said it, but I couldn’t understand what he
said. He said it kind of low and rumbly. I hated
to ask him again,” Annie confessed, looking her confusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, never mind, Annie.” Marjorie smiled away
the maid’s discomfiture with winsome good nature.
“I’ll go down and see for myself. Please say to the
gentleman that I will be down directly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie returned to 15 with the two plates of
sandwiches. If she carried them on into Ronny’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>room she would not go down stairs for the next
ten minutes. Oddly enough she thought also of Hal
as a possible visitor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you changed your mind about letting Ronny
have these sandwiches?” Jerry asked humorously
as Marjorie hastily re-placed them on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I haven’t, Jeering Jeremiah,” Marjorie
laughed. “You are to have the sandwich-moving
job. There’s a gentleman downstairs to see me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What?” Jerry showed mild surprise. “A
gentleman in this girl-inhabited burg! It takes my
breath. I mean to have one call on you at the Hall.
Who is he, or is that a secret?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know who he is. I’m going down to
see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It might be a book agent who has just heard that
you go to college. It might be a tin peddler who
suspects we cook in our room and wants us to try
his tin dishes. It might be a carpet sweeper pest
who has a carpet sweeper that operates in mid air
and simply coaxes the dust up from the floor. Only
those gentlemen always hunt by day. It might
be—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-bye. I’m going downstairs. I can’t stop
to listen to any more of your weird theories, Jeremiah.
I’ll be back soon, I hope.” Smiling over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Jerry’s ridiculous suppositions, Marjorie made a
hasty start for downstairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man who rose to greet her as she entered the
living room bore no resemblance to either her general
or Hal. Her caller was Peter Graham.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, good evening, Mr. Graham.” She held out
her hand. “This <i>is</i> a surprise, but always a pleasant
one. You must have wondered what had become of
Miss Page and me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I knew you were busy, Miss Marjorie.”
Peter Graham’s fine face lighted beautifully at sight
of her. “You and Miss Robin have been very faithful.
It has been of the greatest assistance to me.
Now we must work together, more than ever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He ceased speaking and looked at her with an intensity
of expression which somehow filled her with
vague alarm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it, Mr. Graham?” Her mind would
have instantly formed the conclusion that this call
had to do with some serious crisis in his personal
affairs if he had not said: “Now we must work
together more than ever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The majority of my workers have left me, Miss
Marjorie,” he said with a straight simplicity which
marked him as a man worth while. “They have
gone over to the garage operation. There is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>question in my mind as to how the whole thing happened.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leslie Cairns.” The words leaped involuntarily
to Marjorie’s lips. Immediately what Leila
and Jerry had said before dinner returned to her
mind with a rush. How precisely it fitted with that
one pertinent sentence: “They have gone over to the
garage operation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Miss Cairns is responsible.” He spoke with
quiet surety. “Still, I cannot understand how she
managed so cleverly to keep me in the dark about
her treacherous work until the mischief was done.
Day before yesterday my entire force was at work
on the dormitory. Yesterday three or four of my
most useful Italians did not come to work. By
noon today I was deserted except for four Hamilton
carpenters and builders whom I have known and
worked with for years. These four stood by me.
Every last one of the others went over to the garage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Was there—did these men give their reason for
going?” Marjorie asked with admirable composure.
“Before you answer, Mr. Graham, may I go upstairs
for Miss Page? She happens to be here this evening.
It is her right to hear as well as mine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am glad she is here. It is most fortunate for
us. We shall be able to decide what we can do that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>much the sooner.” The builder bowed abstracted
acknowledgment as Marjorie excused herself and
hurried upstairs. Peter Graham’s mind had dwelt
upon nothing else but what might be done to clear
away the ugly situation resulting from Leslie
Cairns’s malice.</p>

<p class='c006'>She found Robin in the midst of the party group
in Ronny’s room. Under Jerry’s laughable supervision
the eats had been transferred without accident
to the immediate scene of the festivity. Ronny, as
hostess-guest of honor, was in high feather. She
was hospitably concocting a delectable mixture which
she called “Encanta Manaña” as she chatted animatedly
with her friends. It was a fruit punch
founded on lemons and oranges and further improved
by a blending of fruit syrups. These syrups had been
made from the fruits of her ranch home and put up
in the ranch laboratory. They were as welcome at a
spread as was Leila’s imported ginger ale.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her own little coterie of friends had remembered
her birthday that morning with lavish giving. The
top of her chiffonier was covered with affectionate
remembrances, each one selected with a view to
Ronny’s peculiarly strong, attractive individuality.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t stay up here one minute, girls,” Marjorie
hastily told the revelers. They had listened in blank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>silence to her as she acquainted Robin with the dismaying
situation. “Go ahead, and have a good time,
minus Page and Dean. We’ll be back within an
hour, I think; perhaps before then.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A buzzing murmur arose from the group as the
partners exchanged eye messages of undying loyalty,
linked arms and marched together from the room.
Page and Dean would fight gallantly beside Peter
Graham for the good of the dormitory.</p>

<p class='c006'>Entering the living room Peter Graham shook
hands with Robin. The partners seated themselves
side by side on a small settee, while Peter Graham
drew a wicker rocker close enough to them to permit
of low-toned conversation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The builder then began an account of the chief
happenings on the day before the trouble became
evident. He followed it with a more detailed description
of the desertion, first of the three or four
Italians, then the rest of the force, except the four
Hamilton carpenters.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I saw those fellows I had tried to do well
by over on the other lot I knew there was only one
thing had taken them there. They’d been offered
a good deal more money than we were paying them.
I knew Thorne &amp; Foster hadn’t offered it to them.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The builder smiled, a quiet, scornful smile. “They
are niggards.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I decided to go over and have a talk with Pedro
Tomasi, one of the older men of the quarter. He
had always seemed very well disposed toward me.
I went only as far as the edge of the garage excavation.”
He laughed, but in his laugh he showed
his deep-lying indignation. “I was ordered off the
lot by Thorne &amp; Foster’s foreman. What construction
would you place on such an act on their part
after what I just remarked of them.” He looked
levelly from Marjorie to Robin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is only one can be placed upon it,” Marjorie
said tranquilly. “They are simply obeying
Miss Cairns’s orders and pocketing more of her
money.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s it,” nodded Peter Graham. “It will cost
her a pretty penny before she is through with the
affair. I’d like to know how long this business was
brewing before it came to a head. Neither Thorne
or Foster have been in town for weeks. Conlon,
their foreman, is hated by the workmen, especially
the Italians. What I can’t understand is the smooth
quietness of the whole outrage. They walked out of
our employ and into that of Miss Cairns’s like a
carefully organized body of strikers. If Miss Cairns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>managed the walk-out she must have a certain amount
of unscrupulous cleverness,” he ended with grudging
honestness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t the least doubt but that she managed
it,” Robin made indignant assertion. “She has been
known to go to great pains to gain her own way.
On the campus, when she was a student here, she
had a reputation for that sort of thing.” Robin’s information
was meant to be impersonal. It was Peter
Graham’s right to know Leslie Cairns’ measure as
a mischievous force.</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie had listened to Robin and the builder,
her mind weighing every word she heard. As
Robin finished with an angry little sputtered: “Oh,
will we ever be free of that Jonah?” the gravity of
Marjorie’s beautiful face changed to meditative
resolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Graham,” she said, “when first you told me
of this I was really dismayed for a few minutes. I
can understand how you feel in the matter. It is
far harder on you than on us. Still, you know, and
Page and Dean know, that nothing is going to stop
us from finishing the dormitory outside God’s will.
I am sure we have that. We are building toward
good, not evil. I suppose we couldn’t get these men
we’ve lost back again, no matter how hard we tried.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>They’ve gone the way of more money. We paid
them all we can afford or will pay in future. We
must not needlessly increase the dormitory obligation
for the Travelers who come after our chapter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wouldn’t advise taking back any of these men
at a cent more than we have been paying them. We
have given them better wages than they ever before
received,” broke in the builder, defensive of the
Travelers’ rights. “I am glad we are of the same
mind, Miss Dean. And you, Miss Page?” He
turned to Robin, relief written large on his strong
features.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is Page without Dean,” laughed Robin.
“What are we both without Graham?” She made a
charming gesture of deference which pleased and
heartened the white-haired builder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whatever you think wise for us to do, we will
do. We rest our case with you, Mr. Graham,”
Marjorie’s voice rang with fine loyalty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you both for your support,” was the
grateful response. “Our case will have to rest,”
he continued, his face wonderfully brighter, “until
I can secure other workmen to take the places
of those gone. It may be a long time before I can
collect another force like the one we had. They
were able fellows, and knew their business. I warn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>you, the dormitory cannot be completed in time for
the re-opening of college next fall unless we should
have the good fortune to find a new crew of men
at once. That is the situation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We accept it with good grace.” Marjorie’s
kindly cheeriness did much to lighten the secret dejection
of the builder. “Don’t worry over it, Mr.
Graham. We sha’n’t. We have had trouble with
Leslie Cairns before. On each occasion she has
been a loser. We have gone on, the stronger for
experience. We shall rise above this vicissitude,
just as we have risen above the others. Leslie Cairns
never seems even to do wrong successfully.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>GUISEPPE BARETTI’S THEORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Regardless of her optimistic assertion to Robin
and Peter Graham that right must triumph in the
end, Marjorie found it hard to resign herself to
watchful inaction in regard to the dormitory. The
winter days came and went with no change in the
situation save perhaps the addition of a dozen men
to Peter Graham’s working force. It consisted of
himself and his quartette of carpenters. He scoured
the region extending for twenty-five miles about
Hamilton for men. Labor happened to be scarce.
Workmen invariably demanded twice as much
money for their services as he would pay. The affair
of the walk-out had been circulated far and
wide in that section. The numbers of workmen he
talked with demanded as much as “the Thorne and
Foster crew” were receiving.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna Hamilton sputtered volubly to
Jonas, Peter Graham and Marjorie at the dire situation.
She sent for Marjorie, Robin and the builder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>on an average of once in every three or four days
to discuss the situation. She was at first for bringing
in a crew of workmen from one of the large
cities and paying them their own price within a certain
limit to hurry the completion of the dormitory.
She offered to pay the sum needed to do this from
her own resources. To this neither Page and Dean
nor Peter Graham would hear. In the end they
won her over to their way of thinking.</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie’s chief private disappointment lay in the
fact that she could not conscientiously begin the
compilation of Brooke Hamilton’s papers, prior to
writing his biography, until the dormitory question
was settled and off her mind. This had been the
chief reason for Miss Susanna’s generous proposal.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want you and Jerry to come to the Arms in
March, sure and certain,” she said more than once
to Marjorie. “You are such a conscientious child!
You will not humor me at all. Suppose Peter should
have to cripple along all spring with a handful of
men? Then you and Jerry will miss the dawn of
spring at the Arms. Let me tell you you will miss
something.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Miss Susanna, I’ve made up my mind to come
to the Arms the first of March, whether or not the
dormitory business is settled.” Marjorie finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>made this concession one February afternoon while
taking tea with the old lady.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are my own Marvelous Manager, and a
dear child.” Miss Susanna unexpectedly left her
chair, walked around the tea table to Marjorie and
hugged her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you are the dearest of dears. I ought to
come here by the first of March. I feel it as my
duty. And I shall love to be with you. The girls
are resigned to Jerry’s and my move. They’ll be
here about half the time. I give you warning beforehand.
I’ve nothing but chemistry on my list
since the beginning of the semester. I only devote
a few hours a week to it now. I do wish something
would happen to bring some more workmen to the
dormitory,” Marjorie ended wistfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, so do I. I could take that Cairns girl and
treat her to a good shaking with my own strength
of arm.” Miss Susanna resentfully straightened up
from her embrace of Marjorie and vengefully
worked her arms. “And to think, I’ve never seen
her except once, and at a distance.” Miss Susanna
resumed her chair and continued: “It is too bad
Baretti can do nothing with those Italians at the
quarter. It’s the old story. Money changes the
color of everything.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“I was hopeful of Signor Baretti,” Marjorie said,
faint disappointment in her reply. “He went over
to the quarter several times. He said some one besides
Leslie Cairns herself had been influencing the
Italians. He thought she might have hired someone.
The Italians swore that only Thorne and Foster
were responsible for the walk-out. They told
Signor Baretti the bosses had offered much money
to have the work done quickly. He says they are
not telling the truth, but he can’t get at the truth
among them. I had a talk with him yesterday.
Robin and I stopped at the inn for ice cream. He
says he will try again after a while to make the
Italians tell him the truth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He is a fine little man,” Miss Susanna said,
nodding approval of the odd, whole-souled Italian.
“He won’t forget that promise, either.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Guiseppe Baretti had no intention of forgetting
the, to him, solemn promise he had made Page and
Dean. The nearly perfect management of his
restaurant to which he had long since attained
left him a good deal of time to spend as he pleased.
Usually he pleased to be busy in the inn where he
had achieved affluence. It was his workshop, and
he loved it. Now that the “dorm,” also grown into
his peculiar affection, was in difficulties it behoved
him to become a knight errant.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Imbued with this high purpose he went again
and again to the Italian quarter, a patient, open-eared
watchful little questioner or listener, as the
case might be. February was almost ended when
he at last learned something of importance. He
came one evening upon Pedro Tomaso and Francisco
Vesseli engaged in heated argument. He
gathered from the torrent of angry words each
hurled at the other the information he was seeking.
There had been a “Maestro” at the quarter,
it seemed. He had arranged the new scale of wages.
Baretti heard over and over again the name “Ravenzo.”
When he left the quarter it was with four
points fixed in his mind. There had been a “Maestro”
at the quarter. His name was Ravenzo. He
had come from New York. Then had come the
desertion of the “dorm” by the workmen.</p>

<p class='c006'>What Baretti entertained as a positive belief, the
Italians knew nothing of. This was Leslie Cairns’s
part in the dormitory trouble. They placed the
odium on Thorne and Foster. The long-headed
Italian inn keeper laid the primary blame upon Miss
“Car-rins.” He firmly believed if “that one” were
made to “behave good” the troubles of the dorm
would end. He had gleaned here and there enough
of Leslie’s past history to know that she was the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>child of Peter Cairns, a well-known financier, and
that her home was in New York.</p>

<p class='c006'>After his fruitful visit to the quarter he sat down
in his tiny private office at the inn and wrote a
long letter in Italian to a countryman of his in New
York connected with an Italian confidential agency.
The purpose of the letter was to establish the identity
and business of one, Ravenzo.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he had finished the letter he sat very still
for a long time and thought about Leslie Cairns.
Ever since he had first seen her as a freshman at
Hamilton, he had detested her. Now he put her
through a mental revue which did not redound to
her credit. He wondered how her father could allow
her to “boss herself all wrong.” Perhaps her
father did not know half she did. There were many
such cases. He reflected with old-world wisdom
that. “A father don’ want his childr’n do wrong.”
He was also of the conviction that, “A father, he
can’t punish his childr’n they do wrong, he don’
know they do it.” Guiseppe Baretti was sure that
Mr. Car-rins “don’ know much ’bout what his
daughter do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His knowledge of Italian nature told him that if
the scale of wages on the Cairns’s garage was
dropped to what it had been when begun by Thorne
and Foster, the men of the quarter as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>American and Irish workman would be glad to go
back to the fair employ of Page and Dean under the
management of Peter Graham. If Miss Car-rins’s
father knew her as she really was perhaps he would
come and take her away from Hamilton. Miss Car-rins
was of age, but a father was a father. Her
father was a “big” man. He probably would have
ways to make his daughter behave.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such was Baretti’s view of the problem he was
trying to solve. The next day he sat down and
went over the same train of thought with the same
deliberation. On the third day thereafter he resigned
himself to the composition of a letter in Italian.
It was a very long letter and the first draft
of it did not please him. For several days he kept
patiently at it, re-writing and re-vising. Finally he
gave it into the keeping of his Italian manager who
was also a high school graduate. Two days afterward
the manager returned a neatly typed, well-phrased
letter in polite English to the little proprietor.
Guiseppe had the pleasure of addressing an
envelope to Peter Cairns at his New York offices.
Baretti’s last thought in sending the letter was one
of consideration for Leslie’s father. He wrote on
the lower, left-hand side of the envelope: “For Peter
Cairns only.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MOVING DAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Today’s moving day, Jeremiah! We’d better
pack before noon so that the man can come for our
trunks soon after lunch. I shall pack for keeps.
Truly, Jerry, we don’t know whether we’ll be back
here again this year or not.” Marjorie turned from
a yawning trunk which she had pulled into the middle
of the room and surveyed Jerry solemnly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if not this spring, then next fall,” Jerry
said quickly. “Don’t weep, Bean. You will make
me weep, too. I want to go to the Arms, though,
and you have to go. Would you go if you weren’t
going to write the biography?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For a little while, but not for more than that,”
Marjorie said very honestly. “I’m going to miss
the girls terribly, and so will you. We’ll see them
often, but this is a kind of break in the good old
democrat’s platform.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘For larger hopes and graver fears,’” Jerry
quoted. “That’s the way things are. We have
to go on, you know. Life hates loiterers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re just as melancholy over this change as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>I am, Jeremiah Macy!” Marjorie cried out. “It’s
not fair to Miss Susanna.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’ll never know it,” was Jerry’s consoling rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, she never shall,” Marjorie vowed energetically.
“I am still a tiny bit blue about the dormitory
trouble. I wish it had come to an end before
we started our stay at the Arms. Mr. Graham feels
worse about it than either Robin or I. I don’t
allow myself to dwell on the subject of Leslie Cairns.
I feel like joining Miss Susanna in giving the Hob-goblin
a good shaking.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your temper is certainly going to lead you to
violence some day, Bean. That’s the first time I
ever heard you address the Hob-goblin by her household
name. It shows rising ire on your part. Let
me calm you by reciting a few Bean Jingles. Ahem!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, do not rave, then long you’ll wave;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Or with the goblin fight:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Just keep serene, beloved Bean,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You will come out all right.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>I am your friend, unto the end,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I’ll stick to you like glue</div>
      <div class='line in1'>On me just lean, entrancing Bean</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And I will see you through.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Thank you, oh, thank you!” was Marjorie’s
grateful reception of Jerry’s improvised tribute.
“I’d love to have a book of Bean Jingles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ll have to take them down as they are ground
out, then, Bean. I never can remember them afterward.
‘I consider them rather sweet little things.’
Now I must stop entertaining you and get busy.
If you hear blood-curdling wails outside the door
today, don’t collapse. Leila says she may give a
farewell exhibition of true grief in the hall.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The very prospect of Leila’s wails set the two girls
to laughing. In spite of the coming separation from
their close friends the both felt lighter of spirit
as a result of Jerry’s nonsense.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the morning sped toward noon, one by one,
Ronny, Muriel, Lucy, Leila and Vera sought Room
15, the headquarters of all their college years. They
were invited to the Arms to dinner that night in
honor of Jerry’s and Marjorie’s arrival. Now they
hovered about Marjorie and Jerry, trying to be
cheerful at the blow that had fallen. They had
agreed among themselves not to flivver in the
slightest particular. “But after they’re gone,”
Leila had said somberly to Vera, “I shall howl my
Irish head off.” Anna Towne and Verna Burkett
had been invited to take up their abode at Wayland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Hall in Room 15 until either college closed or the
two Travelers came back again to the Hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Robin wanted me to have lunch with her today
at Baretti’s, but I told her I’d meet her there afterward,”
Marjorie commented to her chum audience
as she continued to pack. “She forgot for a minute
that this would be Jerry’s and my last luncheon
at the Hall for awhile. I say that, but I’ll probably
be over for dinner or lunch about day after tomorrow.”
Marjorie straightened up and viewed her
friends with a smile so full of sunshiny good-will
Ronny exclaimed rather shakily:</p>

<p class='c006'>“How silly in us to let ourselves be sad about losing
you, Marjorie Dean. We sit here looking like
a set of sad sentimental old geese. I will not do so.
Here, let’s dance.” She pirouetted to the middle
of the floor in her inimitable fashion and began one
of the utterly original, graceful dances for which
she was famed on the campus. Soon she had swept
the others into it and they were all romping like children.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we’re reported for this racket it won’t do the
reporter any good. We’re vacating today. I suppose
the Phonograph, the Prime Minister and the Ice
Queen will be so pleased to know we’ve vamoosed.”
Jerry smirked derisively in the direction of Julia
Peyton’s room.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Marjorie’s face shadowed slightly at mention of
Doris Monroe. Muriel was still in the dark regarding
Doris’s sudden change from gracious to
hostile. Since her Christmas trip to New York
with Leslie Cairns, Doris had been associating constantly
with Leslie. More than once when driving
with one or another of her chums Marjorie had
seen the white car flash past them with Doris at
the wheel and Leslie beside her. She sometimes wondered
half scornfully whether Doris had not a very
fair understanding of Leslie and her unfair methods.
Then she would quickly reproach herself as having
been suspicious and mean-spirited.</p>

<p class='c006'>After lunch Jerry promised to see the trunks safely
into the keeping of an expressman, leaving Marjorie
free to meet Robin at Baretti’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cut dessert at the Hall today,” was Robin’s
salutatory remark as Marjorie presently breezed into
the restaurant, her cheeks pure carnation pink from
the sharp winter air. “I thought I’d like to have
it here with you. I want some Nesselrode pudding.
You know my weakness for it. Have some? What
will you have?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I ought to say nothing, but I’ll eat an apricot
ice with you. Thank you, Page, for your invitation.”
Marjorie sat down opposite Robin at the
table the latter had chosen. “I finished my packing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>before lunch. It seems queer to be going to Hamilton
Arms to live for a while. None of us dared
say much about it at the Hall today. A flood was
in the offing. But no one flivvered after all. We
smiled at each other at lunch like a whole collection
of Cheshire pusses.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The girls will miss you so dreadfully, Marjorie,”
Robin said with sudden soberness. She looked
across the table at her partner and wondered if
there could ever be anyone more likeable than Marjorie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll miss them, Robin. Jerry and I were ready
to cry this morning until Jerry fell back on Bean
Jingles and we laughed instead. Here comes Signor
Baretti.” Marjorie held out a gracious hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What have you hear about the dorm?” was the
Italian’s first question after he had accepted the
partners’s united invitation to sit.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing encouraging,” Robin answered with a
dejected little shrug. “We are going over there
today to try to keep Mr. Graham in good spirits.
He has such frightful fits of the blues over this miserable
set-back to the dormitory.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; the dorm has a verra bad time. I feel verra
sorry. I have try to help you in some ways, Miss
Page, Miss Dean. Maybe one thing I do have good
after while. I don’ know.” The Italian did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>offer to explain his somewhat mysterious reference.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We know you are always ready to help us,” Marjorie
said with grateful earnestness. “Would you
like to go over to the dormitory with us today, Signor
Baretti? I am sure Mr. Graham would be
pleased to see you. You know Robin and I would
enjoy your company?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think I go with you.” The little proprietor
accepted with a dash of pleased red in his brown
cheeks. “I have bought the new roadster. I like
you to ride in it, Miss Page, Miss Dean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you for suggesting such a dandy way to
escape the wind,” smiled Marjorie. “The first day
of March, and a real March wind. Miss Macy and
I are going to Hamilton Arms today to stay all
spring, Signor Baretti. You remember I told you
before Christmas that I was going there in the
spring.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yes! I remem’er. You are to write somethin’
’bout this Brooke Hamilton. He is name for
the college. Miss Macy—she make another write
’bout him, too?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; she is going to the Arms with me because
she is my roommate. I couldn’t leave her behind.
Miss Susanna wished both of us to come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think your friends in the house you live on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the campus verra sorry you go,” commented the
Italian.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you very much.” Marjorie made him an
arch little bow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are the quite welcome.” The solemn little
man beamed happily upon her. Her merry graciousness
put him at his ease.</p>

<p class='c006'>He showed not a little curiosity regarding the
biography of Brooke Hamilton. He asked a number
of questions about the founder of Hamilton College
and listened eagerly as Marjorie explained as lucidly
as she could regarding the biography of the great
man which she was to write.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the partners had finished their ices Baretti
escorted them, with proud lights in his black eyes,
to his roadster, parked in front of the restaurant in
shining newness. It was only a short run from the
inn to the dormitory. The cutting sharpness of the
east wind, however, made riding preferable to
walking. Seated in the tonneau of the car Robin
and Marjorie had hardly exchanged a dozen sentences
when the car had reached the dormitory site
and was slowing down for a stop.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look, Robin! What can the matter be?” Marjorie
cried in an alarmed tone. Glancing out from
the glassed door nearest to her she beheld a good-sized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>crowd of men collected in front of the dormitory
building.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Robin could reply, Baretti brought the car
to a stop and was out of it and at the door of the
tonneau to assist them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What happen, I wonder?” he asked excitedly.
“Mebbe is Mr. Graham or one his men hurt. You
stay here. I go an’ see. You don’ go up there till
I come tell you all is right. Mebbe is the fight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will wait for you here,” Marjorie cast concerned
eyes toward the crowd of men in an endeavor
to pick out Peter Graham in their midst.</p>

<p class='c006'>As her gaze grew more searching she picked out
the builder at the back of the crowd. He seemed to
be the main object of attention. His hat was off
and his thick white hair was being fluffed out on
his head by the wind. He was waving an arm and
wagging his head as though making a speech. Far
from fighting, the gathering of dark-faced men
was orderly. They were evidently listening to Peter
Graham in an almost complete silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Marjorie, is it—do you suppose Mr. Graham has
been able to gather that crowd of men to work for
him? I hardly dare believe it, but, oh, gracious, if
it should be true—.” Robin clasped her hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it should be,” Marjorie repeated, hope flashing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>into her anxious face. “They are Italians—mostly.”
She added the last word as she made the
discovery that a sprinkling of the crowd were American.
Simultaneous with it she made another discovery.
The tall Italian at the edge of the group was
Pedro Tomaso. She began to recognize others
among that attentive throng who had formerly been
Peter Graham’s men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They’re not <i>new</i> men, Robin!” she exclaimed.
“They are the same ones who went over to Leslie
Cairns’s lot.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There certainly doesn’t appear to be any one left
over at the garage.” As Marjorie called out her discovery
Robin had directed her attention toward the
garage foundation which had risen since Page and
Dean’s workmen had gone over to the other enterprise.
Only a few days before it had been humming
with activity. Now the silence of a tomb hovered
over it. Not a man was to be seen nearer to it
than those who made up the crowd in front of the
dormitory.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If Signor Baretti doesn’t come back this minute
we’ll simply have to join the crowd.” Marjorie’s
voice was freighted with eagerness. “Something’s
gone wrong over at the garage and these men have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>fallen back on Mr. Graham. It must be that. See
how respectful they are. Ah-h, here he comes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Miss Page; Miss Dean; you see there!”
The inn keeper pointed joyously to the crowd.
“They are the ones to leave Mr. Gra’m. Now it is
good enough for them. They have no job atall.
Come a man this morning early. Fire these Italianos,
fire the Americans, fire these men, Thorne an’
Foster. Mebbe fire Miss Car-rins, too, she was
here.” He vented a funny little chuckle on the last
remark.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is the most amazing thing I ever heard.”
Robin stared in a puzzled way at the deserted garage
enterprise. “The only one I should imagine who
could discharge the whole crowd of men would be
Leslie Cairns herself. Perhaps she has sold the
operation as it stands.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; she don’t sell it.” A curiously triumphant
expression sprang into the Italian’s face. “I don’t
talk yet to Mr. Gra’m, for he is too busy. I talk a
little to Tomaso. He tell me this man who fires
everybody come to the lot with Thorne and Foster.
They both looked scare. He look here, look there.
He is verra smart, big tall man. He laugh verra
mad. He say to Thorne and Foster: ‘You are the
couple of skins. You done. Be glad I don’t put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>you in jail. Now you get out!’ Then Tomaso hear
Foster say: ‘You don’t understan’, Mr. Car-rins.’
The big man say: ‘Yes; understan’ you two
thieves.’ So, that is Mr. Car-rins who come here.
He is the father Miss Car-rins. Then mebbe he

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>LESLIE TENDS TO BUSINESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The arrival of the father of Leslie Cairns upon
the scene of her business activities was, indeed, as
Robin had declared, in the light of amazing. More,
that he should have suddenly appeared like a devastating
whirlwind and summarily discharged the
working force engaged in the building of the garage
seemed little short of incredible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on back to the car.” Marjorie caught
Robin by an arm. “I know you would like to join
Mr. Graham, Signor Baretti. Don’t think you must
stay here with us. That’s a man’s meeting up there,”
she nodded toward the crowd. “They wouldn’t feel
at ease if we went up there. We might spoil the
good effect upon them that Mr. Graham is trying
for. We’ll sit in the car and wait for you two.
You go, and help him. You understand the Italian
workmen better even than he.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I go. That is what I want do, but I think I
must stay by you.” Baretti grew radiant. “Pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>soon I come back with Mr. Gra’m. Then you will
hear more that he know.” The inn keeper hustled
toward the crowd of workmen. Page and Dean
picked their way to the car over the rough frozen
earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was fifteen minutes later, and the amazement of
the Italian’s report had not yet died out between the
partners, when the throng around Peter Graham
broke up and the workmen went their several ways.
As a result of their unexpected discharge from their
“fat” job they were a crestfallen set of men.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Italians had led the movement of return to
Peter Graham. With the stolidity of the foreign
laborer, a job was a job. If they were thrown out
of work in one place, they must find work in another.
It mattered not at all to them that they had
treacherously deserted Peter Graham. They waited
on the scene of their disaster only long enough to
learn from Conner, the foreman, that they would be
able to collect their pay checks next day at the
Hamilton office of Thorne and Foster. Their next
move was straight to the dormitory. There they
hung about in the cold until the arrival of Peter
Graham, which had not been until shortly before
Signor Baretti and the partners had arrived.</p>

<p class='c006'>The builder had on that day been on an unfruitful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>and discouraging hunt for men. His surprise at
finding a sheepish but anxious delegation of jobless
men awaiting him had been mixed with grim amusement.
He had seized the advantage which he had
at once saw was his to lay down the law to them.
Of the early morning episode which had brought him
his old corps of workmen he had not yet a clear
story. He was more interested just then in the effect
rather than the cause. The men had asked to
be allowed to take up their old work that day. The
builder refused the request, and sent them home.
“Don’t come back tomorrow unless you feel that you
are going to stick to me until this job is done,” were
his parting words to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little later the builder and Signor Baretti were
walking toward the roadster where the partners
patiently waited to congratulate Peter Graham on
the sudden silver lining that a very gray sky had
turned out. The inn keeper insisted that his three
friends should go to the inn for something hot to
eat and drink. Peter Graham had been too busy to
stop for luncheon. He hailed the invitation. Page
and Dean found hot chocolate and marguerites appetizing
after their stay out in the cold. Even
Baretti broke his rule and drank a cup of very strong
black coffee.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Around the table the four discussed the unexpected
eclipse of the garage operation at length.
They hoped to arrive at a logical conclusion regarding
the reason for Peter Cairns’s high-handed procedure
against his daughter’s business venture.
Greater than the knowledge that their work could
now go on, was the wonder of the partners at the
summary defeat of Leslie Cairns’s dishonorable
scheme. Peter Graham was more concerned with
the return of the workmen than anything else. He
had not passed through three trying years on the
campus with Leslie Cairns always a menace. Guiseppe
Baretti was filled with secret bliss over one
lovely fact. Peter Car-rins had received his letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile Baretti’s new roadster had hardly
made port at the inn when Leslie Cairns turned her
car into Hamilton Pike, bent on a visit to her garage
site. Her special interest, however, was in viewing
the dormitory and exulting in the “crimp” she had
“handed the prigs and digs.” She was well pleased
at having “put one over on that cotton-topped
carpenter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With her affairs progressing so smoothly Leslie
had not troubled herself to visit the garage site for
several days. All that Anton Lavigne had promised
to do he had done. She had seen him but once in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Hamilton. Then he had visited the Italian quarter
as Ravenzo. He had telephoned her to pick him up
with her car at a rather lonely spot on Hamilton
Pike. A small mustache, shell-rimmed glasses and
rough tweed clothing so changed his appearance that
she had hardly known him. He had talked with her
only as long as it took to reach the railway station
where he took the first train for New York. He had
assured her of having done his work thoroughly. As
the winter wore on toward March and the situation
he had promoted remained unchanged she grew
more and more pleased with herself. She was not
specially pleased with Thorne and Stone. In spite
of plenty of help they dragged the building of the
garage. She quarreled with them about it whenever
she saw either partner. She retained them because
of their lack of principle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie spun her car along the pike with her usual
disregard for speed laws. It was cold and she was
not anxious to remain out long in the sharp wind.
She resolved to give the “flivver” and the “success”
the “once over,” then drive to the Colonial, telephone
Doris and invite her to go back to town with her for
the rest of the afternoon and evening.</p>

<p class='c006'>The surprise which had met Robin and Marjorie
on reaching the dormitory was a surprise. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>situation which Leslie found herself facing was a
shock. Her first glance of scowling consternation
deepened as she went nearer the garage foundation
and neither heard nor saw even a solitary workman.
The stillness of the place depressed her. What had
happened to her gang of men? Ah! She had it.
Thorne and Foster had perhaps laid the men off for
a day. She would be charged for the day’s work
they had not done. The builders would collect it
and keep it. Nothing doing! She would drive to
their town office and have it out with them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie shivered as a blast of wind cut through even
her fur coat. She ran back to her car and sprang
into it. She heard the sound of a hammer tapping
away in the dormitory. She grinned derisively as
she glanced up at the half completed edifice. Thanks
to Lavigne, Bean’s settlement house would go a long
time without a roof.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE LETTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Following on the heels of her first shock came
disappointment. She reached the three story building
where Thorne and Foster had established temporary
office to find the door of the office locked and a sign
tacked to the outside door panel which bore the information:
“Gone for the day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who told them they could go?” she sulkily muttered.
“Wait till I see that pair. All they do is
loaf and rob me. They’re slackers. That old cotton-top
Bean has working for her is worth more than a
dozen of these slackers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie swung petulantly down the one flight of
stairs to the street. The wind whistled in her face
causing her to duck her head into her high fur
collar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s too cold to drive back to the campus,” she
concluded. “I’ll run the car into the garage and
hunt for cover. The hotel for me tonight. I’ll go
there and stay there.” She promised herself that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>next day she would make it a point to go to the
garage site and see what was going on. She could
pick up Doris then at the Colonial and take her back
to town.</p>

<p class='c006'>She drove to the garage, saw the car housed and
battled her way against the wind the distance of one
block to the hotel. At the desk the clerk handed her
a letter. Leslie stared at the address in fascination.
Her face turned as nearly white as its swarthiness
would permit. Her lips moved as though she were
trying to speak and could not. Her hands shook so
violently she dropped the letter on the tessellated
marble floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>She bent to retrieve it, and nearly lost her balance.
Sight of certain black, jagged handwriting all but
drained her of strength. She walked to the door of
the elevator steadily enough, but her knees weakened
under her as she stood and waited for what seemed
an age for the descending cage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great Scott!” she breathed in a voice not quite
steady as the door of her room closed behind her.
She stumbled over to a chair and fell into it. “I never
had such a wobbly time in all my life before,” she
said aloud again. “I’m glad to see that writing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie was so staggered at seeing again the characteristic
handwriting of Peter Cairns she had only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>one idea. Her father had written her a letter. In
the exultant glow she experienced as she tore open
the envelope she lost her first panic of agitation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her hands began to tremble anew as she hastily
tore the envelope across, in order to quickly get at
the letter inside it. Two sheets of his club paper
brought a sparkle to her eyes. She unfolded them
and read with hungry concentration:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>Leslie</span>:</p>

<p class='c007'>“So long as you minded your own affairs and did
not involve others in your ridiculous schemes I decided
to let you go on and see if you had any common
sense. You have shown so little of this necessary
quality I have been compelled to interfere and
undo, if possible, the mischief you have done.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are two ways of doing business; a wise
way and a foolish way. Business enterprises are
conducted in order to bring wealth to their promoters;
not for the purpose of “getting even” with
another, or others. I know precisely what you have
been doing since you disgraced yourself and me at
college. I have not once approved of you. Your
purchase of a certain piece of property near the college
was typical of your business idiocy. Some day
you may learn why.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“When you were a youngster I had some hope of
helping you to the career you fancied. You are very
far away from that point of intelligence now.
Prudence should have taught you never to buck
against an institution of learning of the traditional
worth and material wealth of Hamilton College.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have put a definite end to your silly, wasteful
garage venture. You chose the last site suitable for
a public garage. If you make an effort, no matter
how small, or as you may believe, secret, to carry on
this enterprise or to have another carry it on for
you, I will wipe out your fortune and send you to
business college. You have shown sufficient lack of
gray matter to insure my closer guardianship over
you, as your father. For the present Mrs. Gaylord
will remain your chaperon. You thought no doubt
in the beginning that you engaged her. I daresay
you know differently now. Women seldom keep
their secrets. You will arrange to be in New York
not later than the fifteenth of this month. You
are not to return to Hamilton. I have seen Lavigne
and had matters out with him. You deceived him,
but he should have known better than to bother with
you. He has changed his address. You may be
interested in this news.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In New York you will select a suitable apartment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>for yourself and Mrs. Gaylord and resume your
friendship with Natalie Weyman. She is a shallow
creature, but at least has social pride. You are to
devote yourself to society for a while. Perhaps in
that way you may get over your business fallacy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>With a kind of howl such as a mourning, solitary
creature of the wild might utter, Leslie dropped her
head on her arms. She had ever been careless of the
feelings of others; always ready to sneer at even
her friends. Now for the first time in her selfish
life she had been cut to the heart by words.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AT THE ARMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A few days of work on the part of a steady and
greatly chastened crew of men convinced Peter
Graham that his return to good fortune was not a
dream. At the garage site nothing stirred save the
wind-swept branches of the trees and drifting dead
leaves or swaying frozen weeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leslie Cairns had not waited in Hamilton for the
coming of the fifteenth of March. She and Mrs.
Gaylord had gone to New York on the day following
the receipt of her letter. She had not said good-bye
to Doris. She intended to write the sophomore.
Further she would go back to Hamilton later, if
she chose. Her first grief at her father’s cutting
letter had changed into a slow-kindling resentment.
It promised presently to dominate her future acts.
She had determined to learn for herself when she
returned to New York if her father could wipe out
her entire fortune. It consisted of several gilt-edged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>investments. She was confident she would
find a way to secure at least a part of it from him.
She would fight him through the courts, should he
try to impoverish her. He had cast her out of his
affections. She would stamp out her regard for
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>While she vengefully sulked and prepared for a
hasty departure from Hamilton, Marjorie and Jerry
Macy had joined the household at Hamilton Arms.
Their first sensations had been those of strangeness
of their roomy quarters after the closer confinement
of Wayland Hall. They had a somberly beautiful
suite of sitting room, immense sleeping room with
twin carved mahogany beds and bathroom containing
the luxury of a sunken bath.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had made a triumphal entry into the Arms
surrounded by their chums who had been invited to
celebrate the arrival of the beloved guests. The
Travelers had delivered Marjorie and Jerry into
Miss Susanna’s keeping with an exuberance of joy
resulting from their appreciation of the triumph of
Page and Dean over Leslie Cairns. From Baretti’s,
Robin and Marjorie had hurried to Wayland Hall,
gathered their chums into Room 15, and joyfully
told them the news. In consequence, the elation attending
the disclosure served to banish the wrench
of parting.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The Saturday afternoon following their move to
the Arms Miss Susanna gave a reception in honor
of the Travelers to the dormitory girls. The guests
of honor assembled on Friday night, burdened with
their reception finery. They stayed that night at
the Arms and did their own decorating of the stately
rooms the next morning. In honor of their senior
“dorms” a flower scheme of daffodils and violets
had been carried out in fragrant profusion in all
the rooms and at the tables of the famous Chinese
tea room where sweets, ices and tea were served.
Purple and gold were the senior colors and the
modest senior dorms were inclined to be somewhat
abashed at this compliment to them. Anna Towne
plaintively expressed their opinion when she said:
“All this attention makes us believe we count. I
hope we do!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie had been at the Arms a week before
Miss Susanna mentioned Brooke Hamilton in connection
with the literary labor to be performed. She
understood Miss Hamilton well enough to guess that
the peculiar old lady was not yet ready to talk about
the biography Marjorie was to write.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose you’ve been wondering, Marvelous
Manager, why you haven’t been set to work as an
author and biographer,” Miss Hamilton addressed
Marjorie from the sunny bow window of the old-time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>sitting room where she had been watering a
fragrant rosy mass of window box sweet peas. She
picked half a dozen dainty clusters of them and
trotted over to Marjorie with them. She tucked
them into Marjorie’s thick curls, rolled up at the
back of her shapely young head. “There, you look
like the awakening of spring, child,” she declared.
“Come, now, you and I will go up to the study.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Really, Miss Susanna?” Marjorie sprang up
from her chair, radiant at the prospect.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, really. You’re not polite, or you’d take
what I say for granted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Always, in future,” promised Marjorie, holding
up one hand. She wound her other arm about Miss
Hamilton’s waist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jerry has gone to the garage with Jonas for
the car. While she is bringing it up I am going
to do something for you which seems important to
me. I am going to introduce you to Uncle Brooke.
He will welcome you as a friend and make over to
you all his papers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna paused, her eyes searching Marjorie’s
face in the bright, bird-like way which meant
accurate appraisal.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go on; please do,” Marjorie breathed, showing
her utter fascination of the supernatural-sounding
announcement. “It is such a beautiful thought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>that of going with you to his study to be introduced
to him as a friend. Afterward I will gradually
come to the point where I can look over his papers
and not feel—” Marjorie studied an instant “—like
an old Paul Pry,” she added, smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Precisely my idea,” emphasized the mistress of
the Arms. “Let’s be on our way.” She wound an
arm around Marjorie’s waist. Wise youth and
youthful age paraded out into the hall and up the
broad staircase, clinging to each other in fond, school
girl way.</p>

<p class='c006'>The door of the study was a little ajar, as though
someone within the room had anticipated the visit
of Miss Susanna. The study door was generally
closed. Marjorie knew Miss Susanna had set it to
suit her fancy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two paused before the door. Miss Hamilton
gently drew herself free from Marjorie’s arm. She
lifted a hand and rapped lightly on a door panel.
Then she stood in an attitude of alert listening. Marjorie
knew she was re-acting a daily episode of
the long ago. “He is there,” she said softly to
Marjorie. “I will go first. Follow me.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Good morning, Uncle Brooke. I have brought
my friend, Marjorie Dean to meet you. I hope you
are feeling your splendid best today.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna’s voice, gently modulated until
nothing remained of its natural quick, brisk quality,
filled Marjorie with an impulse to cry. It was not
that gentle voice alone which awoke her emotion.
She was looking straight toward a face, strong,
proud, with an almost haughty set of noble dark
head on broad but sloping shoulders. Eyes, startling
in their blueness, a firm mouth, somehow suggesting
humor and shaded by a close-clipped dark
mustache.</p>

<p class='c006'>Marjorie had seen portraits of Brooke Hamilton.
She had never before seen this particular painting
of him. She understood, instantly she beheld it,
why Miss Susanna should take pleasure in regarding
it as life-like enough to merit an introduction. It
had been evidently painted when he was perhaps
thirty and in the glory of his manhood. It was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>life-size study of head and shoulders far finer than
any other of him she had previously seen at the
Arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>A choking sensation rose in her throat. She
fought it back, clenching her hands and resisting
sturdily the impulse to cry. It seemed an age since
Miss Susanna had spoken. In reality it was not
more than two minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uncle Brooke, let me introduce Marjorie Dean.
You wrote the fourteenth maxim for her, though
you did not then know it. Marjorie Dean, let me
present you to my great uncle, Brooke Hamilton.
He wishes to give you his confidence.” Again Miss
Susanna’s voice rose and fell gently on the sunlit
study.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good morning, my friend, Brooke Hamilton.
I accept your confidence as sacred. I will never
disturb the inner deeps.” Marjorie gazed at the
handsome manly face through a mist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Because I have called you friend I will neither
measure out friendship to you in quantity nor lay
a restriction upon it.” It was Miss Susanna who
followed Marjorie’s exalted promise with Brooke
Hamilton’s own creed of friendship.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thank you, Mr. Brooke Hamilton.” Marjorie
bowed sedately. Next instant her sedate air broke
up in a winsome smile. She thought the man in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>portrait looked as though he might have enjoyed
fun and laughter as well as profound consciousness
of responsibility.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And now you’ve been introduced,” Miss Susanna
said naively. “I had Jonas put this portrait
away for awhile. It used to hang in my private
sitting room. I was afraid you might see it before
I was ready to have you. It was painted by a young
Frenchman named Blaneau. He died at twenty-seven.
He would have no doubt been ranked as
the greatest portrait painter of his time had he lived.
Such is the history of the most natural picture of
my uncle I have. He claimed it to be such. If you
like it, it is to stay here and be your inspiration.
Truly, I think the presence of it in the room will
help you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know it will.” Marjorie said fervently. “Oh,
Miss Susanna, do you think I am great enough of
spirit to do him justice?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know you are.” Miss Hamilton’s tone was
victoriously certain. “Would you be amazed if I
were to say that you are like him in some respects?
You are. Your ideals are in keeping with his. He
believed most of all in the romance of deeds, rather
than of love. He gloried in action; the kind that
would most benefit the most people. Yet he found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>after all that love was love, that the romance of
men and women—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Susanna stopped. Came a tense hush. The
idea of Brooke Hamilton as in love had never before
presented itself to Marjorie. “The romance of
men and women” repeated itself in Marjorie’s brain.
There it was again. It was not for her. She would
write the biography of Brooke Hamilton, promote
the interests of the dormitory. She would continue
to hug the romance of deeds to her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not know that romance was still waiting
patiently for her around a future corner.</p>

<p class='c006'>She did not know that beauty and romance hate
separation; that true love seeks true natures. She
had yet to earn that true romance was the inner
heart of love. Her bold sister, adventure, belonged
to deeds. How she learned the lesson of love from
one who had learned it too late for happiness will
be told in “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean’s Romance</span>.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
